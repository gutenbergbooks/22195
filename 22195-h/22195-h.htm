<h2>LITTLE TORA:</h2>
<h2>THE SWEDISH SCHOOLMISTRESS.</h2>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>LITTLE TORA.</h3>


<p>The kindly doctor was entertaining his brother-in-law,
and all the family were sitting round
the table in state. The polished silver and shining
glass, with porcelain, flowers, and fruit, seemed to be
all that had been provided for the dinner.</p>

<p>The usual "grace" had hardly been said, when a
trim maid announced that a little girl was at the
door, who must see the doctor about something
particular. "There is nobody sick more than usual,"
she says; "but she must come in," continued the
irritated damsel-in-waiting.</p>

<p>"Let her come in here. You can never have
your meals in peace!" said the doctor's wife affectionately.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>The soup and the little girl came in together, the
latterly evidently quite prepared to state her errand.
She was a small, straight child, with a determined
air and a cheery face, as if sure of success in her
undertaking. Fresh in Monday cleanliness, her
white cotton head-kerchief stood stiffly out in a
point behind, and her calico apron was without
spot or wrinkle. Her shoes, though they had been
diligently blackened and were under high polish, did
not correspond with the rest of her appearance.
They had evidently been made for a boy, an individual
much larger than their present wearer.
Great wrinkles crossing each other shut off some
low, unoccupied land near the toe, and showed how
much of the sole had been too proud to touch the
common ground. All this the observers saw at once.</p>

<p>"Well, Tora!" said the doctor pleasantly, after she
had dropped her bob-courtesies, and "good-days" had
been exchanged.</p>

<p>"May I sing for you?" said the little girl, without
further hesitation, as she hastily took out a thin, black
book from the small pocket handkerchief in which it
had been carefully wrapped.</p>

<p>"Sing? yes, surely!" said the doctor. "Just the
thing for us while we are taking our dinner. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
brother-in-law here is a famous judge of music, so
you must do your best."</p>

<p>Tora opened the book, took what she considered
an imposing position, and announced the name of
the song. It was a patriotic one, and in the full
chorus of the schoolroom it had stirred the young
Swedish hearts to their depths.</p>

<p>The first few notes were right, though tremblingly
given; then came a quivering and a faltering and
a falsity that made the doctor's boys cover their
laughing mouths with their hands, while their eyes
twinkled with suppressed merriment.</p>

<p>Just then there was a queer buzzing noise in the
room, by which the tune was carried on, and Tora
fell in with fresh courage. Most of the party were
taking their soup, as well as listening; but the boys
observed that their uncle quietly held his motionless
spoon, and was looking at the singer as if lost in
musical bliss. His mouth was closed, but his nostrils
seemed undergoing a rhythmical contraction and distension
most interesting and unusual.</p>

<p>Tora gave the closing notes in fine style, and the
expression of applause was general. So encouraged,
she volunteered a simple newly-published carol that
she had that day been practising at school. Here it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
seemed the musical accompaniment could not be relied
upon. Tora began, stopped, and began again, then
was silent, while great tears stood in her eyes.</p>

<p>One of the before-smiling boys hastened to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let her speak a piece, uncle. She can do that
beautifully, her brother Karl says. He has taught
her ever so many, and it costs her nothing to learn
them. He likes to tell that she is the best scholar in
her class."</p>

<p>The uncle seemed to be able to enjoy his dinner
at the same time as the elocutionary treat with
which it was now accompanied, and he warmly
complimented the speaker on her performance at its
close.</p>

<p>"What made you think of giving us this pleasure,
little Tora?" said the doctor, with a humorous look
in his kindly face.</p>

<p>"Why," said the little girl at once, "I don't like
my shoes. They have been brother Karl's. When I
asked father this morning to give me some new ones,
he said this was a fine strong pair and did not let in
water, and he could not think of letting them go to
waste. Then he looked sorrowful, and I heard him
say to mother, 'The poor children will have to earn
all they have soon.' I made up my mind to begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
at once, and earn my shoes, if I could. Our teacher
told us to-day about Jenny Lind, who began to sing
when she was a very little girl, and when she was
older she made a great deal of money, and gave away
ever so much, and was loved and admired wherever
she went. I thought I should like to be loved and
admired wherever I went, and have new shoes whenever
I wanted them, and I would try singing too. I
came here first because the doctor has always been so
pleasant to me and so good to us all."</p>

<p>"You have made a real beginning," said the
brother-in-law.&mdash;"Gustaf, take round the hat."</p>

<p>The doctor's son ran for his cap. There was a
chinking and a silver flash as the uncle put his hand
into the cap. Something of the same kind happened
when it came to the doctor's turn to contribute. The
mother fumbled confusedly in her pocket, and found
only her handkerchief. The boys tossed in conspicuously
some coppers of their own, perhaps with the
idea of covering, by their munificence, the evident
discomfiture of their mother.</p>

<p>"There! there!" said the uncle. "Hand the cap
to the little girl. What is in it is for the singer.
As for the shoes, I'll see about that.&mdash;I would not
advise you, though, little Tora, to try singing to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
money. It might do for Jenny Lind, but I hardly
think it would suit for you."</p>

<p>The little girl's countenance fell. The friendly
stranger went on, "How would you like to be a
little schoolmistress? That would be a nice way
for you to take care of yourself, and maybe help all
at home, by-and-by. I know how that thing is
done, and I think we could manage it."</p>

<p>The uncle did know "how that thing was done,"
and who meant to do it. Little Tora was provided
for from that day; and so, if she did not sing like
Jenny Lind, she sang herself into being a schoolmistress&mdash;a
little schoolmistress of the very best
order.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>FACING THE WORLD.</h3>


<p>It was five o'clock in the morning on one of the last
days of August. This was no legally-sanctioned
Swedish moving-day, and yet it was plain that with
somebody a change of residence was in progress.</p>

<p>Before a low house on a winding "cobble-stone"
paved street two long, narrow wagons were standing.
Their horses faced in different directions, though in
all other respects the two establishments were, even
to their loading, like a pair of twins. In each was
the furniture for one simple room, a sofa-bed being
the striking article in the inventory. A carefully-packed
basket of china, a few primitive cooking
utensils, and some boxes and packages indicated,
if not good cheer, at least something to keep soul
and body together.</p>

<p>The outer door of the house was locked at last,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and the key had been handed to a humble woman,
who courtesied and took it as a matter of form; though
both parties knew that she would soon be opening
that door and coming into lawful possession of all
the effects, remnants, and refuse left on the premises,
and would be sure to hand that house over to the
landlord in a superlatively clean and tidy condition.</p>

<p>Two stout men took their places as drivers, and
two passengers stood on the low steps for a few
parting words. They were by no means twins. The
straight, slight girl, though not tall, yet fully grown,
had been the little Tora, the singer of one public
performance. Now she had in her pocket her greatest
treasure&mdash;the paper that pronounced her a fully-fledged
schoolmistress; who had completed with honour
the prescribed course at the seminary duly authorized
for the manufacture of teachers of unimpeachable
character, and all pedagogical requisites in perfection.</p>

<p>At Tora's side stood "brother Karl," just about
to start for Upsala University, with his arrangements
complete for his bachelor housekeeping on the
most simple principles.</p>

<p>There was no effusiveness in the parting. "Keep
well, Karl, and don't study too hard," said the sister.
"And don't have any 'food-days'; I could not bear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
that. But you must not live too low, and pull yourself
down. Send to me if you get to the bottom of
your purse. I shall be likely to have a few coppers
in mine."</p>

<p>"I'll warrant that, Miss Prudence," was his reply.
"Nobody but you would have managed to keep us
both comfortably on what was only meant to carry
you through the seminary. Don't be afraid for me!
I shall clear my own way. I shall teach boys in the
evening, and study after they have gone to bed. I
have served a good apprenticeship with the doctor's
chaps these years. I understand packing lessons into
youngsters to be given out in the class next day.
Then I am to write an article now and then for
the paper here, with Upsala news for the country
folks. As to 'food-days,' I am not exactly of your
mind. I have made arrangements for one already."</p>

<p>"O Karl! how could you?" said Tora reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Gunner Steelhammer liked well enough to take
porridge with us now and then when he was teaching
here. His mother has told him to invite me to dine
at their house on Sundays, and to call there whenever
I feel like it. We are real friends, though he is a
university tutor now. Anybody that I would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
willing to help I am willing to let help me. Of
course, I shall enjoy a good substantial dinner once
a week, but I really care more to be with the family
at that house. Gunner is a splendid fellow, as you
know, and his father draws all kinds of nice people
about him, I hear. I did not dare to tell you this
before, little sister; but now I have made a clean
breast of it. I was half teasing about it, too. Be
sure, I'll work hard and live low before I shall let
anybody help me. Well, good-bye," and he stretched
out his hand to Tora, who took it hastily for a hearty
shake, and then they parted.</p>

<p>Karl was wearing his white university cap, which,
with the loading of the wagon, marked him as a
student on the way to Upsala, and would ensure
him many a friendly greeting by the way. Tora
had prudently covered the fresh velvet with a fair
cotton cover; but the blue-and-yellow rosette was
in full sight&mdash;a token of the honours he had lately
won at his examination, and would be striving to
win at the old centre of learning. The kind neighbours
whom he had known from boyhood had added
to his equipment&mdash;here a cheese, and there a pat of
butter or a bag of fresh biscuits; but he did not
need to open his stores by the way. Now and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
again from the roadside houses kindly faces smiled
on him, and homely fare was offered him by the
elders; while flowers or wild berries came to his
share from glad children who had been ranging
the woods for treasures during these last days of
their summer vacation.</p>

<p>As for Tora, sitting in a low chair in the midst
of her possessions, she went rattling over the cobble-stones,
if not more proud at least more happy of
heart than a conqueror of old at the head of a
Roman triumph. She had reached the goal towards
which she had long been striving. She was now an
independent worker, with a profession by which she
could earn an honourable living. She was a teacher,
"a teacher of the little school"&mdash;that is to say, of
the school for little children. The state was her
sure paymaster. If continued health were granted
her, her path for the future was plain&mdash;her bread
was sure.</p>

<p>The cobble-stones were soon passed, and over the
smooth country road rumbled the clumsy vehicle,
now through evergreen thickets, now through groves
of bright birches, and at last out on the rolling
meadows. The fences had disappeared, and but for
a lone landmark here and there, the sea of green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
might have seemed the property of any strong-handed
labourer who might choose to call it his own.</p>

<p>Down an unusually steep slope the wagon passed,
then across the low meadow with a bright stream
threading its midst, and then there was a triumphant
sweep up to the little red schoolhouse where Tora
was to have her abode and the sphere of her labours.</p>

<p>A low wooded point ran like a promontory out
into the meadow, and there "the forefathers of the
vale" had built the temple for the spelling-book and
the slate.</p>

<p>On the opposite side from the meadow the schoolhouse
was entered, after crossing the wide playground.
Where "the field for sport" ended at the road there
stood a lad, evidently looking out eagerly for the
arrival of the new teacher.</p>

<p>"That's a life-member of the little school," said
the driver, with a whimsical look. "Nils is not
much at books, but he's a powerful singer."</p>

<p>The last words were spoken within the hearing of
the frank-faced boy, who now pulled off his cap, and
stepped up to the wagon to help Tora down. She
shook his hand kindly, and said, "I hear you are a
singer, Nils. I am glad of that, for in my certificate
I got but a poor record for my singing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"And 'great A' for everything else, mother said,"
he answered promptly, while his eyes beamed pleasantly
on the new teacher, whose first friendly greeting
had won his heart.</p>

<p>"I'll help you down with the heavy things first,"
said Nils to the driver, "and then if you'll set the
rest here, we'll take them in together later. I want
to show the schoolhouse to the mistress."</p>

<p>The one room set apart for the home of the teacher
did not look dreary as she stepped into it. The table
from the schoolroom stood in the centre covered with
a white cloth, its edge outlined by bright birch leaves
laid on it, loosely and tastefully, like a wreath. Then
on a tray covered with a snowy napkin stood a shining
coffee-pot, with cups for three, and a light saffron
cake that might have sufficed for the whole school
assembled.</p>

<p>"Mother thought perhaps you would like a taste
of something warm after your ride," said Nils, as he
proceeded to pour out a cup of coffee as if he were
quite at home. At home he was in a way, for in
that schoolhouse he had for years passed his days
among the little ones, through a special permit from
the school board.</p>

<p>Tora clasped her hands, and stood silent a moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
before she tasted the first morsel of food in her new
home, and her heart sent up really grateful thoughts
to her heavenly Father, who had so blessed her, and
would, she was sure, continue to bless her in her new
surroundings.</p>

<p>"May I take out a cup to Petter?" asked Nils,
while he cut the big cake into generous pieces, and
offered the simple entertainment to the teacher. Of
course the driver did not refuse the proposed refreshment,
nor did Nils hesitate to help himself, while the
mistress was taking her coffee and glancing round the
premises.</p>

<p>All was fresh and clean about her. The windows
had evidently been open since early morning, and the
closets and shelves could well afford to be displayed
through the doors more than half ajar.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Nils," said the mistress, as she took the
boy's hand after the refreshment.</p>

<p>"Thanks and welcome to the new teacher!" was
the reply.</p>

<p>"Now I shall go in and look at the schoolroom
while Petter and you furnish my room for me. The
sofa should stand there, and the bureau there. The
rest I can leave to you," said Tora, as she disappeared.</p>

<p>Nils unfolded a strip of rag carpeting and "criss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>-crossed" it round the room, whispering to himself,
"Mother said there were to be no footmarks left
behind us."</p>

<p>The schoolroom was but a big, bare room&mdash;no maps
on the walls, none of the modern aids for instruction,
save that the space between the two windows that
looked out towards the meadow had been painted, to
be used as a blackboard: "a useless, new-fangled
notion" the rustics had called this forward step in
the way of education.</p>

<p>In front of the blackboard stood a wooden armchair
for the teacher. The benches were low, and the
desks were of the simplest sort, saving one, which
was larger and higher, which the teacher at once
understood was the permanent arrangement for Nils.
Her heart went out towards the big, kind fellow, on
whom so sore a trial had been laid in his youth.</p>

<p>Along one side of the schoolroom there were four
horses standing silent, but not "saddled and bridled,"
as in old nursery stories. Without head or tail, they
stood on four sprawling legs&mdash;supports for two long,
"shallow boxes" that had been in the schoolroom for
fifty years or more. Wood was abundant in the old
days, and unskilful hands had done the work; so the
boxes were but clumsy specimens of carpentry, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
deep enough, it seemed, to hold sand for all the long
winter through. The grandfathers of the neighbourhood
could remember when these receptacles were
their writing-desks, in which, stick in hand, they
were taught to trace in the smoothed sand their
names or any higher efforts of chirography that the
teacher might demand. These superannuated articles
of furniture were now used in winter as places of
deposit for the children's folded outer garments, rather
than the cold vestibule. There, too, the dinner-baskets
had their rightful quarters.</p>

<p>The room was high, as it went up to the very roof.
On the rafters were stored, in cold weather, the stilts
for summer, and the bundles of ropes for the swings
to be fastened to the tall trees by adventurous Nils,
whose friendly hands delighted to send the laughing
little ones flying far up into the fresh air like merry
fairies. There, too, were the bows and arrows, and
all other lawful things for summer sport.</p>

<p>The little schoolmistress took a full survey of her
new kingdom, sat for a moment in her chair of state,
and noticed a simple footstool put in front of it for
her use, as she fancied, by that unknown "mother"
who seemed to have her comfort so much at heart.</p>

<p>When the new mistress returned to her own private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
apartment, the furniture was all in place, the covers
were taken from the boxes, and everything was ready
for her personal arrangement of her property.</p>

<p>"The school board have had shutters put to the
windows," said the driver, pointing to the late improvement.
"They thought perhaps the new teacher
might be afraid. This is a lonely place."</p>

<p>"Afraid!" said the little schoolmistress, wonderingly;
"I am never afraid, night or day."</p>

<p>The driver opened his eyes wide as he answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The last teacher was as tall as I am, and she always
kept a pistol at night by her on a chair, with an
apron thrown over it, so the thieves could not find it
and shoot her before she had a chance at them. This
little mistress must be made of different stuff.&mdash;Well,
good-bye, miss, and I wish you well."</p>

<p>Tora was about to put in his hand the usual
payment for his services, when he shut his broad
fist expressively, and then half raised it, as he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I never took pay for a mistress's things being
brought to this schoolhouse yet, and I don't mean
to do it now. Folks for the most part seem to like
you, but I have a particular feeling. I knew your
father once, and he was good to me."</p>

<p>The honest man could say no more just then, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
he hurried out of the room. Nils followed with his
best bow, but the pleasant words reached his ears,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We'll meet soon again. Thanks! thanks to you
both.&mdash;I think we shall be real friends, Nils, you
and I."</p>

<p>That little allusion to her father, coming so suddenly,
had almost made Tora break down in the midst of her
abounding courage. The past came up in vivid pictures
where scenes of sorrow were predominant. Her
weak, ever-ailing little baby sister had floated quietly
across the dark river. The stricken mother sank, and
soon followed her child to the churchyard. The
father's hand, that had first guided an editor's pen, and
then in his long decline that of a mere copyist, grew
weaker and weaker, and finally the last loving pressure
was given to his daughter, and then that hand
lay still and white. Its work on earth was done,
and the brother and sister were left alone. Courageous
and loving, they had both struggled on. Her
end was attained, but he was at the beginning of the
steady conflict before him. How would he bear himself
in the battle? If she could only know whether
his surroundings would be as pleasant and homelike
as her own, and his heart as full of hope and
quiet trust! Would he be borne safely through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
privations and temptations of his university life? A
prayer went silently up to the Father of all for that
absent brother, and then the practical little sister was
soon deep in the stir of bringing all things to order
in her new home. Physical effort brought back the
resolute cheerfulness so natural to the little schoolmistress,
and she hummed to herself a simple song of
long ago, to which she could always hear the buzzing
accompaniment of that stranger who had proved to
her a faithful, untiring benefactor and friend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>A NARROW ESCAPE.</h3>


<p>The winter had been unusually long. For nearly
six months the ground had been continually
white. Not that it had been clothed by an ever-smooth,
fair mantle. The snow had been tossed and
whirled by the wild winds till it was fitfully heaped,
now in the meadows, and now banked up against the
very hill-sides. But for the dark woods as landmarks,
the face of the country would have seemed to be
utterly changed. The ice-covered streams were hidden
away out of sight, and the wide ponds appeared but
as smooth pastures.</p>

<p>A path from the little-frequented road had been
kept open to the schoolhouse. Week by week this
narrow way to the seat of learning had been walled
higher and higher, until at last the rustic scholars
seemed passing through a stately white marble cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>ridor as they filed along towards the well-known
door.</p>

<p>The first days of April had come and gone without
a flower-bud to greet them. The weather had suddenly
grown soft and mild, and a drizzling rain had
been falling all night.</p>

<p>Nils appeared early at school; but the tidy mistress
had already cleared away all traces of her modest
breakfast, and was ready to bid him welcome more as
a visitor than a scholar. They had some pleasant
chat together, and then the teacher said seriously, as
she laid her hand on the boy's shoulder, "You must
try as hard as you can, Nils, to do well, or I am afraid
you will not 'go up' this year."</p>

<p>"I do try&mdash;I try as hard as I can!" he said.
Tears suddenly filled his large eyes as he added, "I
am not like other boys, and I know it."</p>

<p>"God knows what you can do, Nils," she said tenderly;
"and He will not judge you for what is not
your fault. It may be, 'Well done, good and faithful
servant!' for you at the last, if you cannot be a
great scholar."</p>

<p>Some merry voices at the door put an end to the
conversation, and the school was soon going on in its
usual routine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Many weather-wise mothers had kept their children
at home, and only eight scholars were in their places,
not counting Nils, who occupied in many practical
things a middle ground between the little ones and
the teacher.</p>

<p>A heavy rain soon began to fall, and pattered
cheerily on the roof, to the great delight of the small
pupils. Towards noon the schoolmistress was hearing
the class read aloud. She sat with her back to the
windows, with the light falling on the book she held
in her hand; but she did not see a letter. Suddenly
she looked up and said, "Nils, please open the right-hand
shutter in my room."</p>

<p>The boy obeyed instantly; but in another moment
he said quickly, "Please come in here a moment,
teacher."</p>

<p>She disappeared immediately, closing the door
behind her. Nils pointed to the window with wide-open
eyes, and said, "The meadow is all afloat!"</p>

<p>"I know it!" she answered calmly. "I saw it
while the children were getting their books for the
class. If the pond above breaks over the banks, we
may be all swept away in a moment. There is no
time to be lost. The children must not be frightened.
I have thought just what to do. You can swim, Nils?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," was his only answer.</p>

<p>"I can swim too," she said. "If anything goes
wrong, we must do what we can for the children."
She looked into the clear, calm eyes of the boy, and
she knew she could trust him. They returned quietly
to the schoolroom. The teacher had hardly taken
her seat and closed the book she had held in her
hand, when there was a loud crashing sound without,
and a heavy thud against the outer door.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Nils calmly, taking his cue from
the teacher. "I put up the bar after the children
came in. I supposed this might happen."</p>

<p>"We don't mind the snow falling against the door,"
said the teacher cheerfully. "We didn't mean to go
out that way. We shall go home by boat anyhow.
I've thought about that before."</p>

<p>"By boat!" exclaimed the children delightedly, for
to them a row or a sail was the most charming thing
in the world.</p>

<p>"But where's the boat?" asked a prudent little
boy, with a sceptical look in his small countenance.
"And where's the water?" he would have added if he
had dared.</p>

<p>"Two boats&mdash;two boats are here! I see them
now!" said the teacher, glancing at the sand-boxes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>&mdash;"Nils, climb up into the rafters and bring down the
oars."</p>

<p>Climbing to the rafters was a familiar exploit of
Nils's. With one foot on his desk and his knee to the
wall, he swung himself up in a moment.</p>

<p>"Hand down my oars and yours," she said, as she
pointed at the stilts; for the little schoolmistress was
a leader in the sports of her children, and often enjoyed
them as much as they did.</p>

<p>The stilts were duly secured, and then the order
followed, "And now the ropes for the launching," and
another glance prompted the lowering of the summer
swings for their new use.</p>

<p>"Give out the clothes, Nils, and call the names of
the children as usual," said the teacher. Those were
no dainty little ones, accustomed to be dressed like
passive dolls by careful nurses or over-fond mammas.
They had but to receive their garments in the daily
orderly way, and to put them on as they well knew
how. There might sometimes be an obstinate string
or button, but Nils was sure to be able to help in any
such difficulty, or even to tie a refractory kerchief
over the light locks. The children now put on their
wrappings mechanically, lost in watching the proceedings
of the teacher and her obedient assistant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>The swings were cut in halves and attached to the
strong handles of the empty sand-boxes of olden times.
"And now we must launch the boats," said the
teacher, with the nearest approach she could muster to
the manner of a bluff sea-captain.</p>

<p>"Heave ho!" shouted Nils, as he put his strong
shoulders to the work of moving the boats, while the
mistress held on to the horses.</p>

<p>One by one the boats were put in what Tora
deemed proper position, the square prows curiously
tilted up to the broad window-seat. Then came the
orders&mdash;"Climb to the top of the shutter, Nils! Pass
that rope round the upper hinge; tie it fast! Now
the other rope on the lower hinge. Right! The
same with the other ropes&mdash;bind them fast to the
other shutter-hinges!"</p>

<p>Every order was promptly and skilfully obeyed.</p>

<p>"Nils, are you sure the boats are perfectly watertight?"
said the mistress, with, for the first time, a
shadow of anxiety in her determined face.</p>

<p>"Tight as a bottle!" was the immediate reply.
"We had them filled with water for the last examination,
to float the boats the children had made. The
ships and such like were here, and the row-boats
and canoes in the other."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw them! I saw them all!" exclaimed a little
chap, with great delight. "My brother had the prize
for his ship, and he made it every bit himself." The
eager memories that came to the minds of the children
were chatted about with an intensity that made the
boats of the moment to be almost for the time forgotten.</p>

<p>Now came the real launching of the boats. With
a proper amount of drawing in and letting out and
holding fast on the part of Nils and the teacher, the
long boxes sat at last on the water like a pair of contented
swans.</p>

<p>"Get down into the boat you are to be captain of,
and I will hand down the oars for us both. Lay
mine across my boat and yours across yours. Your
passengers are to come down first. There will be
four for each of us."</p>

<p>The little schoolmistress, putting on her coat and
fur cap, backed up to one of her little girls, saying,
"Put your arms round my neck, and you shall ride
to the boat."</p>

<p>Two chubby arms went willingly round the neck
of the teacher, as they had done many a time before
on a less momentous occasion. So the little one, with
her eyes away from the window, was backed up to it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to be lifted down by Nils with a merry shout as he
landed the first passenger. The others followed in
the same style, and all the eight were cheerily deposited
in high good-humour.</p>

<p>"Now I'll come down, too," said the schoolmistress,
and she came down the rope as if she were in a
gymnasium. She took her place in the centre of
her boat, with two delighted children before her and
two more behind her.</p>

<p>"Cut loose, Nils! One rope as long as you can,
and the other short up to the stern; and then give me
your knife, and I'll do the same for mine. Now
start, Nils! I'll follow."</p>

<p>The orders were rapidly given and promptly obeyed,
and then the little party started across the watery
stretch that had taken the place of the meadow.</p>

<p>Nils, with his strong arms, got on rapidly, and his
boat was soon far in advance of the other. He neared
the bank, plunged in and drew the uncertain little
craft to the shore, and then as a sledge up the long
slope.</p>

<p>Nils had before decided that he would deposit his
passengers in a sheepfold high on the bank, where he
had seen in the morning a window left open under
the projecting roof to give the poor creatures a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
air. He knew that in the corner by the window
there was a great bin that had been freshly filled
with dried birch branches as food for the sheep. He
left the children looking down at the pretty lambs
and their mothers, and ran back himself to see what
he could do for the rest of the party.</p>

<p>The little mistress was only half-way over, and
evidently managing with difficulty her awkward oars
in the thick, snow-encumbered water through which
she was making her way.</p>

<p>Nils plunged in, swam to her boat, tied the loose
rope round his body, and then struck out for the
shore, while the oars were plied as well as they could
be by the weary hands that held them. His feet had
just touched bottom when there was a loud cheer from
the top of the hill that sloped down to the meadow.
Two great wagons, with a pair of strong horses attached
to each, were coming to the rescue of the
children.</p>

<p>As horses that were good forders and wagons
suited to the purpose were to be selected, some time
had been lost in the preparations after the first news
of the condition of the meadow had been spread
abroad. The question now was how to get the whole
party under roof as soon as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>The drivers were for putting the children half in
one wagon and half in the other; but Nils said in a
tone most unusual for him, "<i>All</i> the children must
go in one wagon, and you will see them safe home,
Petter. <i>We</i> go the other way where the road forks.
Of course, I take the mistress home with me. Mother
wouldn't forgive me if I let her go anywhere else; and
I think I have a kind of right to her too!"</p>

<p>"That you have," said the rough man, with a kind
of little quiver round his lips. "You've earned that
right, anyhow."</p>

<p>And away Nils and the teacher were borne, while
from the other wagon there was a merry "Good-bye!
good-bye! good-bye, teacher! good-bye, Nils!" and a
hearty shout of "Hurrah for Nils!" from the driver,
which came from the very depths of Petter's honest
heart.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>A HAPPY MORNING.</h3>


<p>The home to which the little schoolmistress and
Nils were bound had formerly been a wayside
inn of most modest pretensions. It was but a one-story
red building, with a row of white-framed windows
looking out on the road close at hand. There was
a storm-house, for stamping off the snow and depositing
extra articles of carriage, and for dogs, who, like
the Peri, must stand outside the paradise within.
Next came one large, cheerful room, which served as
kitchen, as well as general place of refreshment and
assembly. On one side of this apartment of manifold
uses were four small rooms for lodgers, furnished
with almost as much simplicity as the prophet's
chamber of the Scriptures, save that a plain sofa-bed
was added in each, as a possible accommodation for
an extra sleeper when there was a throng of guests.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>On the death of Nils's father, the widow had
resolved to retire into private life, as she was comfortably
provided for. Not but that she was willing
at times to give a meal or a bed to an old acquaintance;
but such inmates must conform to the temperance
arrangements of the establishment, for total
abstinence was now the rule of the house. The
widow had declared that her son should not be
brought up with the fumes of spirituous liquors as
his natural atmosphere. Perhaps this resolution had
been prompted by the suspicion that her husband's
life had been shortened by too frequent good meals
and too frequent strong potations. Be that as it
may, the determined woman had made it known that,
now that she was mistress in her own house, she
would manage it as she thought best. The tables
for guests had been swept away (or rather sold discreetly
at private sale) to make room for a spinning-wheel,
a loom, and a sewing-machine, by which the
prudent woman said she was sure she could add to
her substance in a quiet way. "The clicking, the
buzzing, and the slamming," she said, were nothing
to her, and now she could choose what noises she
would have in her ears.</p>

<p>It was not yet time for the usual return of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
son from school, but the mother had begun to go to
the door to see if Nils could possibly be coming.
Perhaps the old habit of looking out occasionally up
and down the road, to reconnoitre as to what customers
might be expected, had lingered to keep the
former hostess now constantly, as it were, on guard.
In one of these excursions for inspection she was
surprised to see a big wagon drawing up before the
door, with the schoolmistress and Nils as passengers.</p>

<p>The driver hastened to tell in an abridged form
the story of their experiences, and to hand over
his charge, with as many orders that they should be
well looked after as if he were the only person interested
in the matter.</p>

<p>The doors to the little bedrooms were always
kept ajar when unoccupied, that they might be at
least not chilly when needed. Two of them were
immediately put into requisition. Nils, as in the
most desperate case, was stripped and rubbed down,
and put into bed at once; and then the little schoolmistress
was looked after. She had obeyed orders,
and her pale face lay on the pillow when she was
visited. The quondam hostess left her suddenly, and
soon returned with a hot drink, which she assured
the patient would make her "quite natural." To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Nils a similar draught was administered, with the
command that he should dash it down at once, with
"no sipping," and go to sleep afterwards.</p>

<p>"Wasn't that whisky?" exclaimed Nils, in surprise.</p>

<p>"There <i>was</i> a drop in it," owned the mother; adding,
"I would give it clear to anybody dying. I am
not wild crazy about temperance, boy."</p>

<p>"Do you think I am dying?" said Nils; and
then he hastily added, "I should not like to leave
you and the schoolmistress; but for anything else I
should not mind. Maybe I should be like other
folks up there."</p>

<p>"Hush, child! You are not dying, nor likely to be;
you are as strong as a bear. A little dip in cold
water is not going to hurt you. That stuff has gone
to your head and made you melancholy-like and
weepish. It does sometimes; it don't generally,
though, just in a minute. You go to sleep; and
don't let me hear anything from you for one while."</p>

<p>The mother put down the thick paper shade, and
set a pin here and there along the edge, to keep out
any adventurous rays of light that might be peeping
in at the sleeper&mdash;"a pin practice" she had sorely
complained of when ventured upon by restless lodgers.
The same process was gone through in the room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
where the mistress was lying. The locks and hinges
of the doors were carefully oiled, and then the agitated
woman sat down to meditate and be thankful.
The meditation proved to be of the perambulatory
sort, for she peeped into one room and then into the
other, noiselessly appearing and retiring. She listened
to see if her patients were alive. The schoolmistress
lay pale and still; her hands, loosely spread
out, dropped on the sheet almost as colourless as
itself. But she breathed regularly; that was an
ascertained fact. Nils was frequently visited. He
gave audible tokens as to how he was enjoying himself.
The mother sat down for the fifth or sixth
time, as it might be, in the great, quiet room. She
did not enter upon any of her favourite branches of
home industry; she thought them too noisy for the
occasion. She was not a reader. She could but
nod a little in her chair, and then make another
round of observation.</p>

<p>At last, towards evening, the schoolmistress was
fairly awake; and such a dish of porridge as she
was obliged to consume! Such a series of inquiries
she was subjected to as to her symptoms and sensations
as would have done credit to a young medical
practitioner examining his first patient, though the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
questions, in this case, were practically rather than
scientifically put, and could actually be understood
by the respondent.</p>

<p>To have quiet was all that the little schoolmistress
craved, and that she was at last allowed. As for
Nils, it was plain that he considered that small apartment
his sleeping-car, for which his ticket had been
taken for the livelong night.</p>

<p>The schoolmistress rose early. Her room was
soon in perfect order. She was reading devoutly in
the Bible: that had been an accessory in the arrangement
of her room, as of all the other small dormitories,
since the hostess "had her way in her own
house."</p>

<p>Tora suddenly heard a quick repeated knock at
her door. The permission to enter was hardly given
when Nils burst in, his face glowing with delight.</p>

<p>"It's all right with me, teacher!" he exclaimed&mdash;"it's
all right with me! You know that hymn I've
tried to learn so many times, and couldn't make out.
The first line came into my head yesterday in our
troubles&mdash;'God is our stronghold and defence;' but
I could not get any further."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that was far enough just then, Nils,"
said Tora. "I thought of that line too myself when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
I first suspected how matters stood, as I sat there
with my book before me."</p>

<p>"But, teacher, I'm all right. This morning I
thought I would read that hymn all over, and I did&mdash;twice.
And then, O teacher, I'm all right, for the
whole hymn just repeated itself in my mind as if I
had the book before me. I asked mother to hear
me, and when she saw I could say it all through without
a stumble, she put her arms round my neck
and cried and talked about herself dreadfully. She
said she had been such a sinner to make prayers and
never believe they could come true; and that she
hadn't taken any comfort, either, in what the doctor
had always been telling her, and that she had thought
was awful. He had said that if anything remarkable
could happen to me, or any great shock, or even
if I had a hard blow on the head, I might come
round like other boys. She had felt sure that nothing
remarkable could ever happen to me; and as to anybody's
giving me a hard knock on the head, she
would not have let that happen when she was by.
She said she had prayed and worried, and never
thought of leaving it all to her heavenly Father,
and now she wasn't fit to have such a blessing. I
couldn't make her glad about it; but she'll come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
round, I'm sure, teacher, if you'll just go and talk
to her."</p>

<p>The teacher's eyes were full of tears of joy as she
took Nils by the hand and said, "You are all right,
I really believe. May God bless you, and make you
a good and useful man."</p>

<p>The mother was not to be found. She was locked
into her own room. There she was pouring out
thanksgiving from the depths of her heart now for
the first time in her life, understanding that she had
indeed a loving heavenly Father, and that even her
faithlessness and ingratitude could be forgiven.</p>

<p>It was a happy morning at the wayside inn.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE PERMANENT PUPIL.</h3>


<p>The dear old schoolhouse had been swept away
in the destructive flood that followed but ten
minutes after the escape of the little schoolmistress
with her pupils.</p>

<p>Intense gratitude for the happy deliverance of the
children spread through the neighbourhood. A public
meeting was called, where the thanks of the community
were conveyed by a dignified and most complimentary
spokesman, to the blushing confusion of
Tora and the astonishment of Nils that he was said
to have behaved so remarkably well on the memorable
occasion. Of course, the newspapers throughout the
country celebrated the praises of the little schoolmistress,
and to the meeting in her honour came her
friends from far and near. "Brother Karl" and his
devoted Gunner made a point of being present, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Tora's buzzing benefactor beamed on the occasion, as
if the credit were all his own.</p>

<p>That there must be a new schoolhouse was a self-evident
fact. It was built as promptly as possible.
The admirable building, with all its modern aids and
appurtenances, was not placed on the old site, but
crowned the summit of a green hill, where nothing
more dangerous than a pouring rain could be expected
to disturb its peace and safety.</p>

<p>When the first term in the new and most desirable
quarters commenced, it was with a stranger as the
teacher. Our little schoolmistress was to spend the
winter in the home where she had been so tenderly
cared for during the long time of bodily prostration
which followed the overstraining of her nervous
system at the time of her escape with the children
under her care.</p>

<p>Busy with spinning-wheel and loom and sewing-machine,
and with her diligent efforts to prepare
Nils to enter with honour a higher school than
that over which she had presided, the winter passed
pleasantly away. Nils's examination surpassed the
utmost expectations of his teacher. His sweet,
grateful humility in the midst of honour was as
touching as his humble submission to the great mis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>fortune which had threatened to overshadow his
whole life.</p>

<p>The little schoolmistress took, with the opening
spring, the place of a private teacher&mdash;a position that
she had been strongly urged to fill. Her first scholar
was a tall fellow, who was sure he could learn from
her in the higher branches much that was important
for him to understand.</p>

<p>The second pupil, who came in later on, was a little
chap. He did not understand Swedish, nor did he
know much in any direction, it was said. But how
could he expect a fair estimation of his abilities, when
the judges were not at home in his language, nor he
in theirs? He, however, improved rapidly, and was
soon not only able to speak Swedish, but comprehended
many matters so well that he was a great
help to the younger pupils who came in by degrees
to be taught. He was too, in a way, a teacher for
the schoolmistress herself, and had his credentials
from the very highest authority.</p>

<p>The class increased as years went on, and was ever
a delightful source of interest to the happy instructress.
The children did not call her "teacher," or "mistress,"
or even "Miss Tora;" they said simply "mother,"
which she thought the sweetest name in the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the first, the tall scholar, who was what Nils
had promised to be, her permanent pupil, he was not
always as obedient and submissive as he might have
been. Even when he sat opposite to her at the
dinner-table, in the presence of stranger guests, he
would sometimes, contrary to her express command,
tell the story of the great April thaw, and the escape
of the little schoolmistress with her pupils. Of course
he was rebuked for his misdemeanour; but he only
protested against her strict government, and declared
that she could never get over "the schoolma'am."
Yet he acknowledged she was always teaching him
something worth knowing through what she was&mdash;the
very best woman and the very best Christian he had
ever had the pleasure of knowing.</p>

<p>This was, it must be confessed, an inexcusably
obstreperous scholar; but Tora would not have exchanged
her husband, her Gunner, the fast friend of
her promising "brother Karl," for the meekest or the
wisest man in the world.<!--<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>--></p>

<h2>A WEEK AT KULLEBY.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>CHURCH SERVICE.</h3>


<p>The church at Kulleby was no dear, old-fashioned
Swedish church, with its low white stone walls
and its high black roof. The bell had no quaintly-formed
tower of its own outside and quite separate
from the sacred edifice, like an ecclesiastical functionary
whose own soul has never entered into the Holy
of holies. No; the parish of Kulleby had its pride
in a great new wooden sanctuary, with nothing about
its exterior, from foundation to belfry, that might not
be seen in any Protestant land whatever. Crowning
the top of a green hill that rose in the midst of a
wide stretch of rolling meadows stood the simple
building. To it came on Sunday the rustics of the
parish as regularly as they went to their week-day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
work. Only here and there in the unfenced churchyard
rose a low mound to indicate where, as it were,
a chance seed had been dropped into "God's acre."</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning. At eight o'clock the bell
had sounded out over the green slopes, and even late
sleepers were called to put on their best garments,
whether church-goers or not church-goers, in honour
of the holy day or holiday, as it might happen to be
kept in their home. Then came the second ringing,
when prudent, far-away worshippers took psalm-book
and pocket-handkerchief in hand and started
demurely, at a Sunday pace, for the house of God.
At a quarter to ten the clergyman had been seen
in the dim distance, and the fact was announced
by "priest-ringing." At ten came the "assembly-ringing,"
when talkers in the churchyard must break
off in the midst of a half-made bargain, or check the
but half-expressed sympathy with the joy or sorrow
of some fellow-rustic with whom there had been a
confidential chat.</p>

<p>Within, the church was all white, with here and
there a gilded line like a bright, holy purpose running
through a simple everyday life. There was a fresh,
pure air about the place, as if even angels might
have gathered there in their fair garments. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
worshippers, however, on the women's side were all
in black&mdash;black dresses, and black kerchiefs over the
heads, like solemn, mourning penitents rather than
followers of the Psalmist who could say, "I was glad
when they said unto me, Let us go into the house
of the Lord." There were two exceptions to this
sombre rule.</p>

<p>The seats facing each other on opposite sides of
the chancel were unoccupied, save by a tall young
woman and a little girl, who now hurriedly took
their places, and in a formal, perfunctory manner put
down their heads for a supposed private prayer for a
blessing on this opportunity of public worship. They
very soon rose up mechanically, and looked about
them with the curious eyes of strangers.</p>

<p>The little girl, nipped, and it seemed almost
blasted, by gales of prosperity, showed a fair, round
face, full and soft, and satisfied with its worldly
portion. The mouth, although it looked as if it had
tasted the good things of life, was sweet and loving.
Her companion was tall and strongly built, and somewhat
gaily dressed in garments made in every particular
according to the latest fashion. Two long ostrich
feathers lazily lolled on the broad brim of her hat,
as much at home as if they had never known any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
other abode; and her new kid gloves fitted her large
hands to perfection&mdash;a fact of which it was plain she
was conscious.</p>

<p>The clergyman was coming in, with the long black
folds which were his authorized substitute for a
gown hanging from the nape of his neck to the floor.
In one hand he carried in full sight a white handkerchief,
held in one corner like a drooping banner of
peace.</p>

<p>There was suddenly a counter object of attention
for the gay worshippers in the side pew. A little
woman in black came hurrying up the aisle and
entered the seat before them. She put down on the
narrow shelf her prayer-book and a tumbled red
handkerchief, and then bowed her head. Suddenly,
in the midst of her devotions, she hastily withdrew
the offending radical handkerchief, and substituted
in its place a heavy linen one, so closely pressed,
as if by mangling, that it lay by the psalm-book as
uncompromisingly stiff as itself.</p>

<p>A smile passed over the features of the little girl,
and she looked up into the face of her companion for
sympathy. Instead of the responsive glance she
expected, she saw an expression of pain which she
was puzzled to understand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>The service went on. The sermon was long and
tiresome, to judge from the impulsive movement of
relief on the part of the little girl when all was at
last over. She was well satisfied when her companion
went down the aisle at an unusually rapid
pace. The rustics generally lingered to hear when
there was to be an auction, what letters were to be
distributed, and other announcements by which a
scattered congregation, rarely meeting through the
week, might be made aware of matters secular and
parochial which it was important for them to know.</p>

<p>The butterfly worshippers had, as it were, flown
away when the mass of the congregation streamed
out from the door. Long, narrow black lines
stretched off in every direction as over the well-trodden
paths the cottagers plodded away to their
homes after this the periodical great event, recreation,
and social gathering of their hard-working lives.</p>

<p>Alone the little woman in black took her way.
Her goal was on the long rocky ridge that bounded
the eastern horizon like a transplanted bit of the
Jura. There was no path for her to follow, but she
made her way over the meadows with the sure
instinct of the swallow winging its flight to its
winter home. He who careth for the birds would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
surely care for her. It was plain she was one of the
humble of the earth in every sense of the word.
Her black head kerchief was old and worn, and her
clumsily-fitting, coarse cloth "sacque" stood out
below her waist as if it were of sheet iron, while
her spare skirts fell below it like a drooping flower-bell
from its open calyx above. She was not thinking
of her clothes. Her heart was warbling a song of
thanksgiving.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>AT THE PASTOR'S.</h3>


<p>Monday morning had come, with work for the
workers and pleasure for the pleasure-seekers.
The curate at Kulleby was one of the workers, and yet
Monday, instead of Sunday, was really his day of rest.
His last sermon having been delivered, fairly given
over to his hearers to be digested, the new one was
not to be begun before Tuesday. There must be one
day in the week in which to draw a free breath before
the real labour of his life was to be recommenced.
The introduction to the discourse once mastered, as
the first link, he added day by day to the lengthening
chain&mdash;a perpetual wearying weight to him, and, it
might be supposed, to become so for his hearers.</p>

<p>This would be a mistake. Had the curate preached
in Hebrew or Greek, the reverent faces would have
been respectfully turned towards him, with the honest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
conviction that somehow or other the listeners were
undergoing a helpful and uplifting process through
what the curate was pleased to say to them. He
was reverenced and beloved, as he well deserved to be,
and was to his people the bearer of good tidings&mdash;the
messenger of peace. <i>He</i> was the message to them,
through what he was and what he was striving to be,
and not through those painfully-produced sermons.</p>

<p>Now for the morning he had dropped the pastor,
and was simply the family father.</p>

<p>The humble home of the curate was separated from
the public road by a great grass plot, through which
a wide walk went straight, without a curve or a compromise,
from the gate to the foot of the high wooden
steps that led to the ever-open door.</p>

<p>The Saturday evening rake-marks were on the
loose sand of the path, for the family had on Sunday,
though in their holiday garments, used the side
gate that led to the entrance at the back of the house.
The garden was large and well cared for. Now the
weekly weeding was going on, the father sitting like
a general at a distance from the battle, but in constant
communication with the soldiers in full fight in the
cause of order, fruitfulness, and prosperity. The
four small boys who were working so busily were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
not under strict military discipline, for free conversation
was allowed so long as the hands continued as
busy as the tongues.</p>

<p>The curate sat on a roughly-made but comfortable
garden sofa, and was knitting on a strong
stocking in sweet composure. A gay-coloured parallelogram
stared out from the grass beside him;
for there, covered with a patchwork quilt, lay, in a
great basket, the baby, the little girl, the pride of
the household, fast asleep. So the curate could
not be said to be exactly idle, though he was taking
a delicious morning rest. His wife meanwhile&mdash;a
large-hearted, practical woman&mdash;was making all things
comfortable in the house, with the help of her efficient
<i>aide-de-camp</i>, an orphan girl snatched from the influences
of the poorhouse. Where a specially strong
arm was required, the curate himself was at all times
to be relied upon. He was not only a hewer of wood,
but often a bearer of wood as well as of water. He
was, too, an embodied guild of all mechanical trades,
and might have been warranted to use skilfully at a
pinch any tools whatever.</p>

<p>The curate gave a start as the click of the front
gate was heard, and almost impatiently wondered who
could be coming.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>A tall young woman walked rapidly along the
rake-marked walk, and dotted it at regular intervals
with the distinct portrait of the soles of her strong
and well-made boots.</p>

<p>She went up the steps decidedly, and entered the
house without knocking, as any ordinary visitor might
have done. In a moment more she appeared in the
garden, with the curate's wife at her side. He stood up
and bowed awkwardly, and then looked inquiringly
at the new-comer. He recognized at once in her the
stranger who had sat near the chancel the day before,
though her dress was somewhat different from her
Sunday attire. She wore a black sailor hat, from
which she had that morning removed the uplifted
wings that threatened to take the whole head-gear
upward, and had left only the broad, bright band that
wound round it. She wore a short, dark travelling
dress that well displayed her new boots. The visitor
did not wait for the curate to speak, but said quickly,
"I will only detain you a moment. Can you tell
me where widow Marget Erikson lives, the old
woman who sat in front, on the side benches, in the
church yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Marget Erikson? Her I know very well, but
it is not so easy to tell where she lives," answered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
curate, with at the same time an inquiring glance at
the stranger. A look of intelligence came into his
face, and he said: "It is not&mdash;it cannot be! no,"
and he turned to the group of small boys, now all
standing, some of them weeds in hand, wonderingly
regarding the stranger. "Here, Kael," said the
father, singling out a fair-haired, intelligent-looking
little fellow, "you can show the young lady the
way to widow Marget Erikson's." Again there was a
scrutinizing, questioning look on the part of the pastor.</p>

<p>A slight flush tinged the cheek of the stranger.
She was turning away with her guide, when the boy
said hastily, "Where's the basket, mamma?"</p>

<p>"There'll be no basket to-day," she answered, almost
with a smile. "You can take Marget this instead
from me," and she picked from her favourite bush a
large, half-open rosebud, with a long stem and rich,
shining leaves.</p>

<p>The boy could hardly understand the love-prompted
courtesy that would not send to the widow what
might to a stranger seem like alms, but which really
was but the sharing of what one poor Christian had
with a poorer.</p>

<p>The guide trotted off with his bare feet across the
meadow, where a little path showed that he was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the first to find a direct way from the parsonage to
the widow's cottage.</p>

<p>"Well, wife? well, Anna?" said the pastor, and
looked inquiringly into the face of his best-beloved, as
he generally did when he was in doubt or difficulty.
It was a face that any one might have been pleased to
look upon. It had in it the bright cheeriness of a
child, and at the same time dignity and a wisdom in
this world's matters, as well as "the wisdom that
cometh from above." He received no answer, and so
said himself: "She was in church yesterday when you
were at little Fia's death-bed. I could hardly help
thinking of you and the child when I was in the
midst of my sermon. The miller told me afterwards
that 'miss' and the little girl were with Possessionaten
something, a traveller who had stopped at the inn
by the cross-road."</p>

<p>There was a sudden end put to the conversation by
a loud cry from the baby, which swept all other
expressions from the face of the pastor's wife, where
at once mother love was triumphant.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>A STRANGE MEETING.</h3>


<p>Across meadows, over ditches, and at last up
rather a steep ascent wound the way to
Widow Erikson's cottage. The path had grown
rough and narrow, but the barefooted boy went over
it as lightly and as unharmed as if he had been a
happy bird. The boots, however, of his companion
seemed a tight fit for climbing, and at last a straggling
bramble that crossed the way turned up two
little black points, like doors, to show the way to the
untanned leather behind the bright polish. The
traveller stopped, and smoothed them down in vain
with her finger; the mischief was done. "This is
an ugly, disagreeable path," she exclaimed, "and a
long one too."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said the boy; "but summer and winter
Widow Erikson comes down here all alone. I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
believe she'd miss the service if you'd give her a
bucket of red apples." The boy had evidently named
his ultimatum in the way of temptation. "There's
the cottage," he added, pointing to a small, reddish-brown
building far up the ascent.</p>

<p>"Give me the flower," said the stranger; "I will
tell her who sent it. You go back now. You've
shown me the way; I don't need you any longer.
Thanks! Thank your mother too. Here!" and
she laid in the boy's hand a bit of silver that made
his face shine. He bowed in his best style, which
did not disturb his backbone, but brought his chin
down till it touched his breast. He had taken off
his cap for the performance, and his white hair fluttered
in the breeze as he watched his late companion
making her way up to the cottage alone. All was
right, he was sure, and down he ran as fast as his
feet could carry him. The precious silver was stored
in the depths of his pocket, and with it he bought in
imagination all sorts of treasures before he reached
home to tell the success of his errand.</p>

<p>The traveller moved slowly as the path grew more
steep, and finally walked doubtfully on as she approached
the cottage. There were three or four low steps
leading to the door, and there some kind of an animal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
seemed making a vain attempt to go up. As the
stranger drew nearer she saw that a small woman
with a short, dark skirt was bowed over, evidently
washing the steps, with her back towards the path
and her unexpected guest. A noise near her made
the figure stand upright and turn its face towards the
new-comer. One sight of the visitor prompted a
series of bobbing courtesies, a wondering look in the
old sun-browned face, and a folding back into a triangular
form of the wet sackcloth apron, which was
truly not in a presentable condition. The old woman
was the first to speak. "Good-day, miss&mdash;good-day!"
and then there was a look of astonished
inquiry.</p>

<p>"The pastor's wife sent you this," said the girl,
holding out the beautiful rosebud she had taken from
the boy.</p>

<p>"So like her!" said the old woman, lovingly.
"She's just like that herself! God bless her! Thank
her for me, please&mdash;thank her for me!" and the thin,
work-distorted, wrinkled hand was hastily wiped on
the apron, and then stretched out to take that of
the stranger for the usual expression of gratitude.
"Thank <i>you</i>, miss, for bringing it," continued the old
woman, with another questioning look at her guest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
"Do you know her&mdash;do you know the curate's wife?
It's likely you don't live hereabouts." The cut of
the stranger's clothes was not in vogue at Kulleby.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me?" said the young woman, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>"No, miss!" was the answer, with another courtesy.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, mother?" was the question
that followed, while the fair face flushed with the
effort those words had cost the speaker.</p>

<p>"It can't be my Karin!" was the exclamation.
There was another period of courtesying, and a long
look of almost unbelieving surprise. There was no
move to take this changed daughter by the hand, nor
was there any such action on the part of the girl.</p>

<p>"I was stopping at the inn with Possessionaten
Bilberg and his little daughter, the one I have taken
care of so long. I found out you were in this neighbourhood,
and so I got some one to show me the way
to where you were living." She did not say that she
had seen her mother at church, nor would she have
liked to own, even to herself, that she was now
repulsed by the appearance and manners of one to
whom she was bound by the strongest of ties.</p>

<p>"Come in," said the old woman, courtesying as to
a stranger. "It's a poor place, but you are welcome."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>A poor place it was indeed, and Karin with her
belongings looked there like a transplanted flower
from a far country. They who had once been so
near to each other seemed now to have almost no
common ground on which to meet.</p>

<p>"I did not know how you had it, mother," said
Karin at last. She had been silenced by her first
view of the poor room.</p>

<p>"It is worse than it was in Norrland, when you
went away, so long ago. Your brother Erik came
home, and was wild-like, as he always was. He
pulled himself down, and was sick a long while, and
then he died. There was the funeral, and the doctor,
and all that; and there was not much left, for of
course I couldn't do a turn of work while I was
nursing him."</p>

<p>"Just like him, to take all you had!" said the
daughter, indignant.</p>

<p>The old woman did not seem to notice the angry
exclamation. A sudden light made beautiful the old
face as she said: "He came round at the last, and
almost like an angel. It did me good to hear him
talk. I didn't mind anything when he had come
round. I am sure he went to heaven when he died.
He was my only boy, and I loved him!" she con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>tinued, as if she were speaking to a stranger; and
then suddenly remembering who her visitor was, she
added: "You would not have known him for the
same. 'Tell Karin,' he said to me&mdash;'tell her she
must forgive me. Tell her to remember she'll need
to have her sins forgiven some time. There's only
one way.' He said so!" and there was another
courtesy of apology that she was talking so to that
strange young lady who said she was her daughter.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said Karin, looking at her watch, "I
must go now. Possessionaten and his little girl were
out for a drive, and I did not leave any word at the
inn where I was going. I will come soon again.
Don't feel hard to me about Erik or anything. Remember
I did not know how you had it. They wrote
me there was a cottage somewhere you could live in
free, and I thought you were getting on pretty well."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have the cottage free. The curate's wife
comes from the north. He married up there, and
they came to visit her folks. She heard about me,
for she was there when Erik died. She knew about
this cottage, and nothing would do but I must come
down with them; and so I did. You can't think how
kind they have been to me. I've done a power of
knitting since I have been here. She sees that some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>body buys my stockings. But you must go. Come
again," said the old woman, in strange confusion
between her daughter that was ten years ago and
this strange young lady who had condescended to
look in upon her.</p>

<p>They parted without even a shake of the hand.
The old woman stood at the door and watched the
tall girl hurrying down the path, and felt almost as
if she had been in a troubled dream.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>TOO LATE.</h3>


<p>Possessionaten Bilberg was subject to
transient indispositions on Sunday morning.
The symptoms that had prevented his being at the
church service the day before seemed to have disappeared
entirely on Monday. He came home from
his drive with his daughter in unusually good spirits;
and as for little Elsa, she was quite delighted. She
had had a nice play with some charming children,
and there was a baby in the house, which she had
really been allowed to carry in her own willing arms.
Karin's overshadowed countenance passed unnoticed in
the general stir that followed the return of the father
and daughter. They had been invited to spend several
days at the hospitable country home where they had
been so warmly welcomed. It had been urged that
while Elsa was happy with playmates of her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
age, Possessionaten could see many things in the
neighbourhood that might be suggestive to him,
interested as he was in agriculture and manufactures.
Planning and packing took all the afternoon, and
towards evening the carriage was at the door, and
Elsa and her father were to take their departure.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you would be lonely, Karin, and
sorry we are going away; but you don't seem to mind
it at all," said the little girl, in an injured tone.</p>

<p>"So you want me to be sorrowful," answered Karin,
trying to be playful.</p>

<p>"No, no! but I thought you would miss me,
and I was glad when papa said you could keep on
sleeping in my nice room, and be as comfortable as
anybody."</p>

<p>There was a little condescension in the tone,
though it was affectionate; but Karin did not notice
it, for she was accustomed to Elsa's airs and graces.
Karin really drew a sigh of relief when the carriage
drove away and she was left to herself. It was not
a pleasant evening that she spent, filled with the
thronging reminiscences of the past and a full
realization of her own shortcomings. To-morrow
she would make another visit to her mother, and try
to be more frank and affectionate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>The morning came, and Karin was busy clearing
all traces of a traveller's comfort from the capacious
bag that Elsa had been allowed to give her for the
journey. It really would hold a great deal, and filled
it was to the uttermost at the country shop to which
Karin easily found her way; tea, sugar, and tempting
articles of diet, which she hoped her mother
would enjoy. It was heavy, but Karin rather liked
to feel the pain in her arm, from bearing her unusual
burden. She easily found her way along the upward
path, and exhilarated by the exercise and the pleasure
she was about to give, she entered the cottage in a
very cheerful frame of mind. All was silent within.</p>

<p>In the box sofa-bed of the single room there was
some one lying, pale and still. "She is dead!" was
the first wild thought of distress; but a sweet, broken
voice murmured something about Erik and heaven.
It was plain that the old woman was wandering in
mind, and lost in visions of the past.</p>

<p>Karin unpacked her basket in a hurry. There
were the preparations of the night before for the fire
and the boiling of the water for the morning meal, to
be simple indeed. Yet there was a packed basket,
"the basket" no doubt from the parsonage. She did
not unpack it, though it seemed filled with food.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
She made some tea in haste, and took it with a
biscuit to her mother's side. She put the cup on a
chair near her, and sitting down on the edge of the
bed, she lifted up the old woman, passing one strong
arm about the little body. There was gentleness and
kindness in the touch. The old head was voluntarily
drooped caressingly against the breast of her daughter;
there was a long sigh, and Karin knew she was
motherless. Repentant, sorrowing tears flowed fast.
There was no opportunity left for reparation in this
world. That loving last movement towards her was
the only pleasant thought on which Karin could
dwell.</p>

<p>How still it was in the cottage! The birches
without scarcely quivered in the soft summer air, and
not even the twitter of a bird was to be heard.</p>

<p>Karin had just gently laid the old head on the
pillow, when a form, almost to her as of an angel,
suddenly appeared at the door. It was the pastor's
wife, her face beaming with the tender interest she
was feeling for the lone dweller in the cottage. She
understood the whole as she saw Karin's streaming
tears, and the changed old face beside her.</p>

<p>"My mother is dead!" said Karin simply, but in a
broken voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad she saw her good daughter before she
died," said the pastor's wife comfortingly.</p>

<p>"I am no good daughter!" exclaimed Karin
bitterly. It was a relief to confess her selfishness,
her forgetfulness of her mother, in the midst of her
own comfortable surroundings, and her cold willingness
to believe that all was well with that old woman,
who she had supposed was still in the far north.</p>

<p>The pastor's wife listened in silence. She had no
words of comfort to say. Here was a case beyond
her treatment. She did not kneel, but she clasped
her hands and sat quite still, while she laid Karin's
sorrow and penitence before the dear Lord Jesus, so
ready to forgive, and to heal the broken, repentant
heart. When she had closed the prayer with a
fervent "Amen!" which seemed to be the sealing
of her petitions to the One strong to save, she turned
to Karin and said, "I will go down and send a person
to watch her, and then you must go with me to our
home; for I have heard that you were left at the inn.
You cannot be there now." She felt that it would
be best for Karin to be for a time alone. She had
brought her to the heavenly Presence, and she left
her there to commune with the pitiful Father in
heaven.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>KARIN AND ELSA.</h3>


<p>There was a new, low mound in the churchyard.
Kind young hands from the curate's
had covered it with evergreen boughs, and sprinkled
among them bright flowers, so that it seemed but a
slight swell in the green sweep around it dotted with
daisies.</p>

<p>Karin had begun a new phase in her life. She
had something to love and respect which had no
taint of this present world and the worldliness
reigning therein. She had entered humbly and
heartily into the simple life at the curate's home,
where she had been so lovingly welcomed.</p>

<p>That thin man, with the angular, loosely-built figure,
with a speaking expression of poverty about it; that
man whose shabby Sunday coat had not a button-hole
that did not publicly tell of privately-done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
repairs by his wife's untailor-like hand; that man
whose very hair was scanty, and was changing colour&mdash;she
looked up to him as if he had been a prince.
And so he was; for he had a Father who was King
over all the nations of the earth, who loved him as
a son, and received from that son the happy, truthful
affection of a true child.</p>

<p>That woman who went about in the simplest of
garments, and shunned no form of labour that made
the home more comfortable or attractive, had become
to Karin a model of all that was pure and lovely and
lovable. The baby, who fell much to her care,
seemed to have a healing influence on her wounded,
humbled, penitent heart. It had for her its artless
smile, and its little arms went out to her as trustfully
as if she had never strayed from the narrow
path. Karin had a new standard in life, a new
picture of what she wished to be, a new way of
estimating her fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>Karin was glad that circumstances made it necessary
for her to lay down in the depths of her
capacious trunk the gay garments that had been her
pride. There had been no dressmaking, no consulting
of milliner or <i>modiste</i>. Like most Swedish girls,
she had a black dress; she had but to put a crape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
band over her sailor-hat, and let the short crape veil
fall over her solemnized face, and her mourning suit
was for the present complete.</p>

<p>This time, this precious time, went away all too
rapidly, but it swept from Karin the impressions
of years, and strengthened in her, day by day, the
new purposes and the new hopes that had sprung
up in the midst of her humiliation and distress.</p>

<p>From the cottage in the woods the daughter had
but taken away her mother's "psalm-book" in its
close-fitting black cotton case, her worn Bible, and
the carefully-folded white handkerchief that lay
under them. In the corner of the handkerchief a
large K had been embroidered by unskilful hands.
Karin knew it as one of her own early trophies, that
had been given to her mother in pride when she had
received it as a reward for skill shown in the sewing-class
at school. This little remembrance of her had
been treasured and prized while she was living in
selfish forgetfulness of the poor old woman far away.
Repentant tears had fallen on the humble memento.</p>

<p>On the morning of the day when Possessionaten
Bilberg and his daughter were expected, the curate's
wife went with Karin to the inn.</p>

<p>The parting between them was full of grateful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
expression on the one side, and of tender interest and
kind advice on the other. They were never to meet
again on earth, but they had a common Father in
heaven above, in whose presence they trusted one
day to be united.</p>

<p>Karin was, of course, on the steps of the inn to
receive her charge. It was not unusual for Karin
to wear sometimes a black dress, and Elsa, in her
pleasure at the meeting and her eagerness to tell her
late experiences, did not notice anything particularly
serious in the face of the maid. When, however,
they were alone together, she looked up suddenly, and
saw that Karin's eyes were full of tears as she was
struggling to speak of what had befallen her.</p>

<p>"What is it? what is the matter?" asked Elsa
affrightedly.</p>

<p>"My mother is dead! I have lost my mother!"
said Karin simply.</p>

<p>Elsa cast her arms around Karin's neck in an
unusual fit of demonstrative affection, and wept
with her. "O Karin, what will you do? How
you must have loved her! How sorry you must
be! I have thought a great deal about a mother
since I have been away. I have always missed
something, and felt that I was different from other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
little girls, but I did not really understand what it
was. I have had everything I wanted, and papa has
been so kind, and you too, Karin, but there was
something. Where I have been the children did so
love their mamma, and she made it so charming for
them, and she had such a sweet way with them;"
and here the little girl sobbed, more, it must be
owned, from thinking of what she had missed in her
life than from sympathy for Karin, and yet they
were drawn nearer together than ever before.</p>

<p>The stir of the arrival of Possessionaten Bilberg
and his daughter had passed away from about the
inn, and stillness reigned around on every side, on
the wide meadows in front, and on the long, low,
rocky ridge beyond them. Possessionaten Bilberg
was smoking a cigar in the wide porch, and quietly
thinking. Elsa had flown down to tell him of
Karin's trouble, and now he greeted the trusted
maid almost with respect as she came to him to
ask some questions about their approaching departure.</p>

<p>He got up stiffly and took Karin by the hand, as
he said simply, "I am sorry to hear that you have
had trouble. Your mother was old, I daresay," he
added, as he dropped her hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, old and feeble," was the reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Karin waited a moment, and then began to speak
of the journey.</p>

<p>"Yes; it will be this evening," he said, and his face
wore a most peculiar expression, as if some struggle
was going on within him.</p>

<p>At last he began: "I have had time to see more of
Elsa than usual, and when she was with young companions.
There is something about her as if her
pleasure were the most important thing to everybody,
and she rather thought nobody was quite equal to
herself."</p>

<p>It is possible that these peculiarities had become
Elsa's by inheritance, as her father was not without
his own tendencies in that direction&mdash;a fact of which
he was naturally unconscious.</p>

<p>He went on: "You have been a good girl, Karin,
and I am pleased with you. Elsa needs now some
one who has a right to take her more steadily in
hand."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and the tears sprang to Karin's
eyes. Was she to be dismissed, when she felt
almost as much at home in her master's house as
his daughter herself?</p>

<p>"Yes, you have been a good girl, Karin, and you
deserve your reward. You never ought to leave my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
home. What Elsa needs, though, is a mother's care.
She needs one who with a mother's name will have
a strong right to her respect and her affection."</p>

<p>He paused a moment. Karin, not knowing what
else to do, dropped a courtesy, and waited for him to
go on. He got up, blushed, took a few steps on the
piazza, and then turned and said abruptly: "I am
going to be married, and I want you to tell Elsa
about it. Tell her that it is the lady whom the
children called 'aunty' there in the country&mdash;their
mother's sister. She is willing to marry me. I
never thought to get such a good wife." And
Possessionaten Bilberg looked humble, for perhaps
the first time in his life.</p>

<p>"She is not like me in many things," he continued,
as if pleased with his subject. "She is pious&mdash;something
I don't quite understand, but it makes me sure
she will be a good mother to Elsa. I really believe
she would hardly have taken me if she had not
longed to get my child under her care," said Possessionaten,
with another unwonted attack of humility.
"Please tell Elsa at once," he said, and sat down
again, to indicate that the interview was over.</p>

<p>In a few moments Elsa came flying along the
piazza, and surprised her father by taking a seat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
on his knee and putting her arms round his neck.
"Papa! papa!" she said, "how could you think of
doing anything that would please me so much?"</p>

<p>"Your own mother loved her, Elsa, and so I am
sure she is the right kind of a woman, and that you
will be happy together."</p>

<p>Possessionaten had spoken in a matter-of-fact sort
of way, and Elsa went upstairs in a less ecstatic
mood than when she came down, and told Karin
calmly that her father seemed pleased that she
liked having a new mother.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>CHRISTMAS EVE.</h3>


<p>Christmas Eve had come. There had been
joy in the curate's home&mdash;carols and prayer
around the lighted tree, the distribution of simple
gifts, and the consumption of any amount of rice
porridge. Even the grave pastor had grown playful
as the evening went on. This had prompted one
of the boys to exclaim that he was the very best
father in the world&mdash;a comprehensive assertion that
was approved by all parties present. The power to
cast off care and even serious thought for a time,
and frolic with children, was one of the secrets of
the curate's personal power. In his sacred capacity
he was above and apart from all; as a father or a
friend he was near and familiarly dear to all, even
to the youngest in his household and the humblest of
his people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Now he gave a start, and there was a look of
astonishment all round the family as there was the
sound of heavy cart-wheels grinding along over the
sand under the parsonage windows.</p>

<p>In another moment there was a steady tramping
on the side steps, then through the passage to the
dining-room, where the family were assembled.</p>

<p>Four strong men were bearing a huge box, and
now entered, much embarrassed at being unable to
take off their caps in the presence of the pastor, but
their deep voices pronounced a "Good Yule!" and
their thick, soft caps went off in a hurry when they
had deposited their heavy burden. "We were to
open it, pastor," they said, and they forthwith produced
their tools from the slouching pockets of their
strong coats. The pastor's wife disappeared instantly,
thinking, as usual, of others more than of herself;
for she, too, would have liked a peep into the box
when the thick boards had been thrown up and the
packed stores were first visible. She had, however,
what pleased her better&mdash;some hot coffee, a cake of
saffron bread, and the remains of the porridge on the
table in the kitchen when the last nail had been
drawn out. The men disappeared, grinning with
satisfaction; while the wondering children superin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>tended, with occasional wild dances and leaps of delight,
the unfolding of the secrets of the wonderful box.</p>

<p>A prosperous "possessionat" who had learned that
the chief joy of possession is the power of giving had
sent household stores on a munificent scale. A happy
wife, accustomed to see her own husband always
dressed as for a holiday, having a full remembrance
of the pastor's outer man, and of his wife's forgetfulness
of herself, had sent for him a full black
suit, and for his wife a handsome dark dress, as well
as a warm fur cape. A little girl, who had learned
to remember that there were other people beside
herself to be thought of in the world, had selected
books and toys for the children. The orphan girl
had not been forgotten. She looked with astonishment
at the substantial winter coat that had been
marked with her name, and wondered who could
have thought of <i>her</i>. There was still a beautiful,
closely-woven white basket, with a firm handle, at
one side of the box. It was lifted out and opened.
There were all sorts of things&mdash;potted, canned, dried,
and preserved, to make, with good bread and butter,
a nice evening meal for an unexpected guest; a most
welcome present in a family where hospitality never
failed, and yet the larder was often scantily pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>vided. At the bottom of the basket lay a card, on
which was written, "From a humble friend, in remembrance
of 'the basket.'"</p>

<p>The tears rushed to the eyes of the curate and his
wife, and their hands met, while their thoughts were
with the little old cottage saint now in heaven, and
a prayer was sent up for the daughter that she
might continue to walk in the ways of peace.</p>

<p>"O mamma, what a good basket to keep all your
mending in!" said one of the boys.</p>

<p>"Just what I will do," said the mother; "I shall
like to have it always near me."</p>

<p>"Do put on your new suit, papa," urged the
children. He vanished into his room close at hand,
and soon reappeared transformed into a new and
complete edition of his old self, as it were, in a fine
fresh binding.</p>

<p>The suit was not a perfect fit, but hung less loosely
about him than his wonted best garments, made
long, long ago.</p>

<p>The pastor playfully walked up and down the
room with a consequential air, to the great amusement
of the children. "You will wear your new
suit to-morrow!" they exclaimed, one after another,
as in the refrain of a song.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"On New-Year's Day, perhaps," said the father.
"For to-morrow I like my old suit best; for we are
to remember then how the loving Lord of all humbled
Himself to be the Babe of Bethlehem."</p>

<p>There were a few words of prayer and thanksgiving,
and then the family, with a kiss all round,
parted for the night.</p>

<p>Perchance the angels who sang again the Christmas
song, "On earth peace, good will toward men,"
lingered over the curate's home with a kindred
feeling for him; for was he not, too, a messenger,
sent "to minister for them who shall be heirs of
salvation"?<!--<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>--></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>A FOOLISH RESOLVE.</h3>


<p>Tall, handsome, and young; that one saw at
a single glance. The age of the lad it was
not easy to determine. The mind wavered between
sixteen and nineteen, but sixteen it really was. It
was no true Swedish face, yet such faces are often
found among the fair children of the North. The boy
had a clear, dark complexion, and his waving hair
was intensely black. His nose was decided, but there
was a weakness about the small mouth that seemed
quite inconsistent with the fiery glance of the full
brown eyes.</p>

<p>It was late, yet he was sitting looking steadily
before him, while his thoughts were evidently wandering.
"<i>So</i> they want me to promise, and <i>so</i> they want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
me to live?" he said at last. "I cannot make promises
I do not mean to keep. I can do many things,
but I cannot take a false position as to what I intend
to be." He stood up and straightened his whole person
with an admiring self-respect as he spoke.</p>

<p><i>He</i> would not be compelled by public opinion to do
that for which he was not inclined! He was old
enough to choose for himself, and choose he would!
He would not be confirmed! He would not assume
obligations contrary to his wishes, and make professions
he did not honestly mean! There seemed to
him to be in this something noble, something determined,
something manly, and he pleasantly reflected
upon his righteous independence.</p>

<p>The confirmation was appointed for the morrow.
He had seen the slender, swift horse that was to be
his&mdash;a gift from his father. He knew a gold watch
was lying in his mother's drawer, to be one of his
many presents to commemorate the important occasion.
The guests were invited for the splendid dinner his
parents were to give in his honour. He would be
expected to appear in one of the stylish new suits
provided for him as now a fully-grown young gentleman.
He would be toasted, complimented, and, in
short, the hero of the day in that beautiful home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
He knew that his mother had retired early. She was
doubtless praying for him then, and would be on the
morrow. She, at least, would expect him to keep his
promises. She should know that he would not disgrace
her by a false oath.</p>

<p>His pocket-book was well filled by a munificent
present from his grand-uncle in America. He could
go where he pleased. He took out a small, light
trunk from one of his closets, and it was soon packed
with his new garments and a few specially dear
personal valuables. There were no books but the
pocket Bible, in which his mother had so lately written
his name. For her sake he would take it with him,
and for her sake he would open it at least for five
minutes every day.</p>

<p>Stealthily he crept down the staircase and through
the broad halls, dropped from a low window, and was
soon in the open air. There was a light still in the
stable-boy's room, and he would so have help for the
harnessing of the horse, and an opportunity to leave a
parting message for his mother.</p>

<p>He moved slowly and silently. He looked in
through the small panes, and could see the boy
bending over a book. He tapped gently. There
was a start, and the door was opened in a moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going to town, Lars," he said, "and I want
your help. Get up the spring wagon as soon as
you can."</p>

<p>The stable-boy looked suspiciously at his young
master, and at the small trunk he had set down
beside him. "Where is Master Alf going?" asked
the boy anxiously. "Anything dreadful happened?
Won't you be here for the confirmation?"</p>

<p>"No; it's that that sends me away," was the
answer. "I can't even seem to make promises I
don't intend to keep. I mean to be an honourable
gentleman, and I shall not begin that way. Come,
hurry!"</p>

<p>"But stop, Master Alf! Why don't you make
the promises and try to keep them?" said the
stable-boy.</p>

<p>"I suppose that is what you mean to do&mdash;eh?"
said the young gentleman scornfully.</p>

<p>"It would be my duty any way to live right,"
was the answer. "I can't see that the promises make
any difference. I ought to live right, I know, and I
mean to try. It won't be easy. That's all I understand
about it." The round, dull face of the boy
expressed clear determination, and he looked his young
master full in the eyes as he spoke. "Perhaps you've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
made up your mind to go wrong!" he added, with a
doubtful look at his companion.</p>

<p>"Do as I bid you, and get up the horse at once!"
said Alf, in a commanding tone. "Tell my mother
what I have said to you, and tell her, too, I have
taken with me the Bible she gave me, and I'll read
in it a bit every day for her sake. <i>I</i> believe in
keeping promises. As for you, you'll find the team
at the usual stable; you must go in early to-morrow
for it."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Master Alf?" urged the
boy. "I'm afraid it's clean out to the bad!"</p>

<p>"That's none of your business! You don't know
how a gentleman feels about a promise," was the
answer.</p>

<p>"My father is here for the confirmation. He talked
to me about that matter last night," persisted Lars.
"He said when people were married they promised
they would be good to each other, but that was their
duty any way, if they were man and wife, promise or
no promise. About confirmation, he said that was a
good old custom that it was well to follow, but any
way when boys get to our age they've got to make
up their minds what sort of men they mean to be,
and start clear and determined on the right track, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
else they'll be sure, as the world is, to go to the bad.
He said, too, we'd better be in a hurry, and have that
fixed, for there was no saying how long even young
folks would live. Young folks might be broken off
right sudden, like a green branch in a high wind. I
do wish you, Master Alf, could hear my father talk
about this thing."</p>

<p>"I've heard you talk; that's quite enough of the
family for me!" said Alf impatiently. "Attend to
your business at once, will you, or I shall have to
harness the horse myself."</p>

<p>"I <i>wish</i> my father was here, I do!" murmured
Lars to himself, as he most unwillingly obeyed.</p>

<p>"That's for your sermon," said Alf, as he took the
reins in his hand, and tossed a bit of silver to the
serious, stolid-faced boy who was looking so sorrowfully
at him.</p>

<p>As Alf said his last words to Lars, he wished in his
heart that he had the stable-boy's full, simple determination
to do right whatever it might cost him.
The veil of self-contentment had fallen from Alf's
eyes. His motives for what he was now doing stood
out plainly before him. It was true that he did not
wish to pledge himself openly to a life he did not
intend to lead, but it was also true that it had long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
been his cherished wish to be free from the restraints
of home, and able to yield to any and all
the temptations that assailed him. He was voluntarily
giving himself up to an evil, reckless life, and
he knew it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>AFTER THIRTY YEARS.</h3>


<p>The slender birches were sunning their mottled
stems in the warm spring air; the evergreen
woods rose dark and mysterious; while the glad
little spruces that skirted the thickets were nourishing
soft buds on every twig, little caring that they
would in time be as gloomy and solemn as the grand
old veterans of the forest behind them.</p>

<p>Sweden once more! All seemed unchanged after
thirty years, save the emigrant and whatever specially
concerned him. The familiar homes far back from
the road, he remembered them well. His own home,
he knew, had been ravaged by fire, and scarcely a
vestige of it remained. His parents were no more.
He could not, if he had wished it, shed penitent tears
over their graves; for their bones were mouldering in
a far-away ancestral vault, with no kindly grass to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
mantle them, and no glad wild flowers to whisper of
a coming resurrection. The possessions that should
have been his had been willed away to strangers.
The once well-known family name was now rarely
heard in the neighbourhood, and then only sorrowfully
whispered as connected with the sad and almost
forgotten past.</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning. The church bell had
rung out its peals the appointed number of times,
and now all was silent, for the rustic worshippers
were gathered within the sacred walls.</p>

<p>The congregation were all seated, and the Confession
was being repeated, when a tall, slender man,
with peculiarly broad shoulders and a peculiarly
small waist, came with an ungainly gait up the aisle,
holding in his hand a limp felt hat as if it were
glued fast to his long, thin fingers.</p>

<p>He stopped a moment, as if mechanically, before a
full pew, and then stood doubtfully in the aisle.</p>

<p>A little chubby girl perched just behind him had
not been too devout to observe the proceedings of the
stranger. She unhooked the door of the seat in
which she was established alone with her mother.
The slight click attracted, as she had hoped, the
attention of the new worshipper. She whispered to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
her bowed mother, "He has no place to sit; may I
let him in to us?" The head was slightly nodded in
reply; the door was gently pushed open; and the
stranger sat down in the offered place. His dark
face was thin, and wrinkled too much apparently for
his years. His thick black hair and beard were
irregularly streaked in locks with white, rather than
grey with the usual even sprinkling brought about
by age alone; and his forehead threatened to stretch
backward far beyond the usual frontal bounds. He
apparently took no part in the service. His eyes
seemed looking far away from priest and altar, and
his ears were dead to the words that fell upon them.</p>

<p>Above the chancel there had been a painting
representing the Lord's Supper, not copied even
second or third hand from Leonardo's masterpiece,
but from the work of some far more humble artist.
The cracks that had crept across the cloth of the holy
table and scarred the faces of the disciples were no
longer to be seen. The disciples, whose identity
had so occupied the minds of the little church-goers
and been the subject of week-day discussions, were
now hidden with the whole scene from the eyes of
all beholders. A red curtain veiled the long-valued
painting in its disfigured old age. Against this glow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>ing background was suspended a huge golden cross
of the simplest construction. It was, in fact, the
work of the carpenter of the neighbourhood, and was
gilded by the hand of the pastor's wife, who had
solemnly thought to herself as she wielded the brush,
"We must look to the cross before we may draw
near to the holy supper."</p>

<p>Some idea like this flitted through the mind of the
stranger, though he did not appear like a devout
worshipper. His whole bearing gave quite another
impression. Even when, during prayers later on, he
held up his hat before his face, as is supposed to be
a devout attitude in some Christian lands, the little
girl fancied she could see him peeping here and there
round the church, as if he were taking an inventory
of its specialties. It was but a simple country
church, with square pillars of masonry supporting
the galleries, from whence light wooden columns rose
to the vaulted roof. Indeed, in the old-fashioned
building the rural seemed to have been the only style
of architecture attempted. The whole interior had
been thoroughly whitewashed, however it had fared
with the hearts of the worshippers.</p>

<p>During the sermon the stranger was evidently lost
in his own meditations. As soon as the service was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
over, he followed the clergyman down the aisle to the
sacristy, on one side of the main door.</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman was in the midst of
disrobing, when the dark-faced man hastily entered
and said abruptly, "Will you kindly look over this
paper, which must be my only credential with you?
I belong to this parish, and should be glad to have
the privileges of membership when broken down and
needing a home."</p>

<p>The pastor glanced at the paper. It was a simple
certificate, from a well-known dignitary high in
authority in the land, requesting that the bearer,
without being subject to further investigation, should
have his right acknowledged as a member of the
parish to which he now made application. The
pastor could treat him accordingly, only showing the
paper in case any difficulty arising from this arrangement
should make such publicity necessary.</p>

<p>The paper was properly signed, witnessed, and
sealed. The pastor put it in his pocket, looked
wonderingly at the applicant, and said, "The poorhouse
is but a mean place, with accommodation for a
few persons, and the present occupants are of the
humblest sort. There are now living there an old
woman, formerly a servant in respectable families,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
who has a room to herself; a half-mad fellow, who
will not speak when spoken to unless he can hit on
some way of answering in rhyme. He, of course, has
a room to himself. There is, besides, a large room
with sleeping-places for two persons. One of these
places is occupied by an old man who has been a
hard drinker; you would have to share the room
with him. Would you be contented with that
arrangement?"</p>

<p>"Contented and grateful," said the stranger. His
name was given as "A. Johanson," and was so
registered in the pastor's note-book. Particular
directions were then kindly lavished on the stranger
as to how he was to reach his future home.</p>

<p>A peculiar smile stole over the face of the listener.
He took politely the permit which ensured his admittance
at the last refuge of the unfortunate, and
then, with a bow and a slight waving of the limp
hat, he disappeared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>IN THE POORHOUSE.</h3>


<p>The poorhouse was not an imposing structure,
but it could boast of antiquity, as it had been
built long, long ago for the purpose for which it was
now used.</p>

<p>It was not difficult for Johanson to locate the poorhouse
poet. His room, like the other two, opened
directly on the vestibule. On his own door he had
been allowed to paint his name and publish his chosen
occupation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I take my bag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My legs my nag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fetch the mail."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So ran the poor rhymes, yet the mad poet had not
given himself his full meed of praise. No storm was
too wild, no cold too severe, no snow too deep for the
faithful mail-carrier to make his rounds. Rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
than give up the leathern bag entrusted to him to
teasing country boys or desperate highwayman, he
would have died in its defence.</p>

<p>The principle of growth had exerted its power
eccentrically with the poorhouse poet. His legs and
neck were elongated out of all proportion to the rest
of his body. His small, pale face was raised unnaturally
high in the air, as if he had suffered
decapitation and his head had been posted as an
assurance that offended law had been avenged. Unconscious
of his own peculiarities, the persistent rhymer
went about pleased with himself and all the world.
Now he was particularly happy, for he considered
himself a kind of presiding officer at the poorhouse,
and as such the proper person to show the premises
to curious strangers, or to formally install new inmates.
On the entrance of Johanson with the pastor's permit,
the poet immediately took the odd-looking pauper in
hand, to make him at home in the establishment.</p>

<p>He knocked at the small room opposite the main
entrance, and a shrill voice having shouted, "Come
in!" the visitors opened the door.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I bring a new-comer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our guest for the summer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's Johanson, he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gull Hansdotter, she."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></div></div>

<p>So presented, Johanson bowed to the little old
woman, who stood up beside the chair in which she
had been sitting, and deigned to bend her knees for
a courtesy just sufficiently to bring her short skirts
possibly one inch nearer the floor. Her stiff demeanour,
however, changed suddenly as she darted
to a corner and produced a bit of rag carpet, on
which she requested the visitors to stand, as her
room had been freshly scoured for Sunday.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Scour Sunday,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scour Monday,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scour every day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's her way,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>said the poet, retiring precipitately with his companion.
The poet had described the absorbing pursuit
of his fellow-lodger. Chairs, table, and floor in
that little room were subject to such rasping purifications,
that if there had ever been paint on any of
them, it was a thing of the far past, while an ashy
whiteness and a general smell of dampness were the
abiding peculiarities of the apartment. The eyes of
the owner had become possessed of a microscopic
power of discovering the minutest speck that might
have been envied by any scientific observer of insect
life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>The poet next threw open the door of the room
opposite his own, as he said to his companion,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here is your place&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No want of space;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">According to diet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not always so quiet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These were the quarters Johanson was to share
with the broad-chested man in a big chair, who sat
with a stout stick beside him, as if ready at any
moment to meet the attack of a roving marauder.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This is our cellar-master,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lived faster and faster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till here with us he had to be.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's Johanson who comes with me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'll share your room, at least to-night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And longer if you treat him right."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was only an inhospitable grunt from the
gouty, red-faced man whose biography had been more
justly than politely abridged for the new-comer.</p>

<p>Johanson had no luggage to deposit. He thanked
his conductor for the trouble he had taken, and then
seated himself on a wooden chair on his side of the
room, and had evidently no further need of his guide,
who promptly disappeared.</p>

<p>Johanson seemed gazing out of the window, but
was really seeing nothing, while quite lost in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
own thoughts, and altogether forgetful of his companion.</p>

<p>There was a pounding on the floor, followed by a
rumbling sound, as of some one preparing to speak,
and then the other occupant of the room said roughly:
"Here, you! Do you see that crack across the middle
of the floor, with three big, dark knots in the middle
on each side of it? That's my landmark. You come
over it, and there'll be mischief!"</p>

<p>"I shall take great pleasure in attending to your
wishes. It is not likely that I shall visit you often,"
said Johanson, rising and bowing with much politeness,
and then promptly resuming his seat.</p>

<p>The next step of the new lodger was to take a
small, carefully-covered book from his pocket. The
gilt edges, dulled by time, were, however, observed by
the watchful spectator, a prisoner in his chair. The
fine print and the divided verses were evident to his
keen eyes, that twinkled in their red frames with an
uncanny light. "No hypocrisy here! it don't take.
Put up that book, or I'll throw my friend here at
you. I never miss, so look out!" He touched the
club-like stick beside him.</p>

<p>Johanson quickly put his hand in his breast-pocket
and took out a small revolver. "Here is <i>my</i> friend,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
he said. "I never miss with this in my hand!" He
spoke coolly, but his eyes were fearless and determined.
"You let me alone, and I'll let you alone.
I want to live peaceably. I shall do what I please
on my side of the room, and I want no meddling
from you."</p>

<p>The cellar-master understood at once that he had
here a person not to be trifled with, and from that
day there was no difficulty between them.</p>

<p>The revolver may or may not have been loaded,
but the sight of it had been enough for the cellar-master,
as for many a "rough" before.</p>

<p>As to the little woman who had given Johanson so
ungracious a reception on his first appearance in her
room, he had evidently taken an aversion to her
society. When she came into his duplicated quarters,
he was always looking out into the street, or so occupied
that she had a better view of his back than of
his face. He never named her, nor was she ever
mentioned in the establishment by her lawful cognomen,
but was always spoken of as "she," representing
alone, as she did, her own sex in the poorhouse.</p>

<p>It seemed to her a wonder that with all her claims
to respectability she had ever found her way to her
present home. The walls of her room were decorated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
with silhouettes of this or that grand personage in
whose service she had enjoyed the honour of being in
days of yore. Such mementoes failing her, there were
coveted seals to letters, or paper headings cut out and
duly pointed at the edges, to shine forth from red
backgrounds. A daguerreotype of herself, in all the
buxom freshness of youth and the "bravery" of a
gaily-adorned peasant costume, was always to be seen
standing on her bureau half open, like the book of
an absent-minded scholar disturbed in his researches.
Her pretensions imposed not a little upon the cellar-master,
who treated her with a certain respect; but
the poet was unmindful of her social claims, and
perhaps took a pleasure in showing his independence
of her rule. Rule it was, for she condescended
to cook for "those poor men folks," as she called
them.</p>

<p>Not that her cooking was ever of an elaborate
order&mdash;coffee and porridge being the only dainties on
which she was permitted to display her full powers.
Warming up and making over other dishes kindly
sent in by benevolent neighbours she did to perfection,
and showed in this matter an ingenuity most
remarkable. When, however, she took in the meals
she had prepared for the various recipients, it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
with a studied ungraciousness, abated only for the
cellar-master, who, as she said, had a respectable title
of his own, and was suitable company for her.</p>

<p>Johanson, who had come to his present abode
empty-handed, provided himself by degrees with
needful articles of clothing of the simplest sort, as
well as necessities for the toilet and the writing-table.
The pen was much in his hand. It was used occasionally
for a letter to the nearest large city, and
such a missive was generally followed by a parcel,
which was stowed away at once in the capacious
chest appointed for his use.</p>

<p>The cellar-master was sure that it was on sheets
ruled like music-paper that Johanson was almost constantly
writing, though they were locked up in his
chest almost before they were fairly dry. He did
not seem to be a reader, but the objectionable little
book with the gilt edges came out at a regular hour
each day, and for five minutes at least had his full
attention, without offensive interruption.</p>

<p>On the whole, the poorhouse had become for
Johanson a peaceful and in a measure a comfortable
home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>PREPARING FOR CONFIRMATION.</h3>


<p>With the autumn began for the pastor the most
pleasing duty of the year&mdash;the instruction of
his class for confirmation. He announced in church
one Sunday that after the service he would be in the
sacristy to take the names of any of the young people
who wished to join the proposed class. He was sitting
in the sacristy at the appointed time, with a group of
young rustics standing about him, when Johanson
came quietly in.</p>

<p>"I can attend to you first," said the pastor, turning
kindly towards the dark-bearded man.</p>

<p>"I can wait; I am in no hurry," was the reply.</p>

<p>The waiting was long, as had been expected.
When the boys and girls had all gone out, Johanson
stepped to the pastor's side and said, "Please put down
my name."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"For what?" asked the pastor, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"For the confirmation class," was the calm reply.
"I have never been confirmed."</p>

<p>The pastor had noticed, naturally, that Johanson
had not been forward to the Lord's Supper even when
the cellar-master had been helped up the aisle from
the poorhouse seat near the door, and Gull and the
half-mad poet had decorously followed. At this he had
hardly been surprised, for there were other members of
the congregation who did not communicate more than
once a year. The good man felt a sudden repulsion
towards the stranger still without the Christian pale.</p>

<p>"You wish then to be confirmed?" said the pastor,
looking Johanson directly in the eye.</p>

<p>"I wish to receive the instruction, and it will be
your duty to judge of my fitness afterwards," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could find time to teach you privately,
though it is a busy season, with all the certificates of
removal and that kind of thing," said the pastor
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I would rather be taught as you teach these young
people," said Johanson. "Please try to forget that I
am not a boy."</p>

<p>That was a hard duty to impose on the pastor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
who looked into the browned face and the troubled
dark eyes. He did not promise, but simply said,
"The class, as you heard, will meet in the dining-room
at the parsonage on Wednesday afternoon. I
hope the instructions may be blessed to you," and
they parted.</p>

<p>Wednesday came. The available chairs in the
pastor's simple home had been ranged in long rows
on each side of the dining-room.</p>

<p>"May I sit here, dear, with my work?" said the
pastor's wife, coming in with a basket of stockings
in one hand, her needle and yarn for darning in the
other.</p>

<p>She did not expect to be refused, nor was she,
though a little girl of five years old, her only child,
held pertinaciously on to her dress. "I may come
too, papa; I am sure I may," said a sweet, cheery
voice, and only a pleasant smile was the reply. The
mother sat down in one of the chairs still at the
table, and the little girl took joyously a place at her
side.</p>

<p>"I always like to hear your confirmation instructions,
for many reasons," said the wife. "I seem to
take a fresh start in the right direction with the
children."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>The pastor seated himself at the head of the table,
with his books before him, laying near them the list
of the names of the class.</p>

<p>The pastor was a stout, sensible-looking man,
with a plain, quiet face, and a modest, shy air.
Indeed, he was hardly at ease anywhere, except in
his home, or in the pulpit or chancel, where the sense
of the sacredness of his official duties made him
unmindful of earthly witnesses.</p>

<p>Now he thought it a stay to have his wife with
him; for the informal nature of the meeting, and the
beginning of something new, made the whole at first
an effort for him.</p>

<p>Perhaps the pastor, in the presence of persons of
high standing, found it impossible to forget his humble
birth, and suspected that in some way there was
always a lack of gentility about him; while with companions
of more modest pretensions he must maintain
the distant dignity which he fancied appertained to
his profession.</p>

<p>He was a straightforward, matter-of-fact man, who
intended in all things, temporal and spiritual, to do
his duty. He believed fully in the inspiration of the
Bible from cover to cover, and was possibly convinced
that every word, and almost every letter, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
then authorized Swedish version had a sanction not
to be disputed. In his view the sacraments, properly
administered, were direct, undoubted channels of
grace. The organization of his church was perfect,
he was sure, to the least particular, and would have
the approval of the apostles were they now on earth,
though during their lives the circumstances of their
surroundings might have made it impossible for them
to have their ministrations conducted according to the
admirable order so long established in Sweden.
Martin Luther he looked upon as having a kind of
supplemental apostleship, almost as incontestable as
that of Peter himself. Luther's catechism was for
him the best medium for imparting religious instruction
to children, and for strengthening the Christian
life of young people approaching maturity. With
this sound, hearty belief in what he was called on to
teach, and with the rules for his ministrations, his
work was simple and most agreeable.</p>

<p>The pastor was not an emotional man. He had
never been deeply stirred by religious feelings of any
kind. He had had no agonies of penitence, no distressing
doubts, no strong struggles with temper, no
vivid thought of the possibility of his being excluded
from eternal blessedness. His heavenly Father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
was to him rather a theological abstraction than a
near and ever-loving friend. The Saviour was to
him more an element in a perfect creed than the
Deliverer&mdash;the hand stretched out to the drowning
man&mdash;the one hope of poor tempted humanity.</p>

<p>The pastor was, in his way, a good man, a kind
man, an unselfish, true, sincere man. Peaceful he
lived, peaceful he ministered, and yet heart to heart he
came with no human brother. With no human brother,
we say; but there was one woman whose life interpenetrated
his, if they did not in all things come heart
to heart. Her presence gave him a sense of sunshine
and quiet happiness that was the greatest joy of
which his nature was capable.</p>

<p>Merry, impulsive, devoted, self-sacrificing by nature,
the whole existence of the pastor's wife was pervaded
by a Christian life that exalted her naturally lovely
traits, and made her shortcomings the source of a
sweet, childlike penitence that was almost as lovely
and attractive as her virtues. She had soon found
that the deep language of her inner soul was to her
husband an unknown tongue. Of her spiritual
struggles and joys and exaltations she did not speak to
him or to any other human being. They were her
secret with her God and Saviour. Yet her husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
stood to her on a pinnacle, as rounded in character,
blameless in life, and perfect in his ministrations.
Almost angelic he seemed to her when he stood in the
chancel, and in his deep, melodious voice sang all the
parts of the service that the church rules allowed to
be so given.</p>

<p>The pastor's sermons were excellent compositions.
Compositions they were in the strictest sense of the
word. The epistles and gospels for the ecclesiastical
year were the authorized and usual subjects for the
sermons, being called even in common parlance "the
text for the day." These texts had been so elaborated
and expounded by wise divines whose works were to
be had in print, that when a sermon was to be written,
our pastor but got out his books of sermons, studied,
compared, compiled, extracted, transformed, and rewrote,
until on Friday his sermon for the coming Sunday
was always ready. He had made it his own by hard,
conscientious work, and not without a deep sense
that he was, in his way, to deliver a divine message
as an authorized ambassador of the King of
kings, accredited and appointed in an unimpeachable
manner.</p>

<p>With his confirmation class the pastor was different.
He was fond of young people. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
been young himself, and had not forgotten the
circumstance.</p>

<p>He was getting a little impatient to see the fresh
faces he was expecting at the first meeting of the
class, when Johanson made his appearance, bowed
distantly, and took the seat nearest the door. He
had passed through a knot of young people without,
who were, with some cuffing and shoving, contending
who should go in first on this to them august occasion.
Johanson had left the door slightly ajar, and little
Elsa, the pastor's child, having caught a glimpse of a
familiar face, ran out, to come back immediately leading
triumphantly a rosy-cheeked girl, who was all
blushes as she was brought into the dining-room, made
to her for the time sacred ground. Of course, the
whole troop from without, boys and girls, followed,
taking opposite sides of the room.</p>

<p>It proved that Johanson had taken his seat on the
girls' side, and carefully away from him the skirts of
those nearest to him were drawn; for it had been
whispered around the parish that the queer man at
the poorhouse had never been confirmed. An outcast
of the outcasts he must be, was the common
conviction.</p>

<p>A hymn was to be sung, all sitting, to open the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
meeting. Little Elsa went round with the "psalm-books"
in a basket, and began with Johanson, who
took one as he was requested. The pastor began, and
the young voices joined him. There was a hush for
a second, when a wonderful tenor came in, and seemed
to fill the room with a strange melody.</p>

<p>But one verse was sung; then followed a short
prayer from the church liturgy, after which the lesson
began.</p>

<p>Johanson sat alone in his corner, when Elsa tripped
away from her mother, and giving a gleeful little
hop, she seated herself beside him, laid her small hand
lightly on his knee, and looked up at him lovingly and
protectingly as she did so. Now she felt she really
owned him. He was <i>her</i> poor man, a kind of friend
and relation to her.</p>

<p>Through all those long preparatory lessons Elsa
kept her place by the side of the dark man, without
word or comment from her parents.</p>

<p>The time for the confirmation was drawing near.
"I do not know what I shall do about Johanson,"
said the pastor to his wife. "I get nothing from him
in the class except plain, direct, and most correct
answers to my questions. I suppose it must be all
right, but we don't seem to come near to each other at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
all. He is a wild, strange man. Perhaps you could
somehow get on better with him."</p>

<p>"Maybe Elsa could," said the wife. "<i>She</i> loves
him. Perhaps that is what he feels the need of among
us who call ourselves Christians."</p>

<p>"Call ourselves Christians!" repeated the pastor, in
as severe a tone of reproach as he had ever addressed
to his wife.</p>

<p>She did not seem to notice his manner, but went
on: "Elsa might reach him. You know it says, 'A
little child shall lead them.' I'll send her to the poorhouse
this afternoon with a message to Johanson from
me, and the book she likes so much. I know which
is her favourite picture, and she will be sure to tell
him about it."</p>

<p>"Send her to the poorhouse!" exclaimed the pastor.</p>

<p>"She's been there often with me when I've been
there to wind up Gull's clock, which she is sure to
get out of order if Gull touches it herself. Elsa is not
afraid of any of them, even of the cellar-master. He
really likes her."</p>

<p>The pastor was called away suddenly, and he was
glad, for that was one of the occasions when he did
not quite understand his wife.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>LED TO THE LIGHT.</h3>


<p>Little Elsa's errand to Johanson was to take
to him a small pocket "psalm-book" (as the
Swedish book for the services and hymns is called).
It was well known in the poorhouse and parish that
the stranger pauper had a Bible, and read it too, at
least for five minutes every day. Gull, who had a
strong taste for gossip, had not left that particular
unmentioned.</p>

<p>Elsa came in with two little packages in her hand.
"Here's your book mamma sent you," she said.
"She has put your name in it. I want to show you
my book too."</p>

<p>Johanson put his gift in his pocket hastily, with a
short expression of thanks, and then looked expectantly
at the child.</p>

<p>"May I sit close to you, so we can both look over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
it together?" she said, as she pushed a chair to his
side and worked herself up on to it.</p>

<p>The illustrations were generally from Old Testament
scenes; but Elsa hurried past these, turning the
pages briskly with her skilful fingers.</p>

<p>"Here it is! Here's the one I like best. You
understand it, don't you? It means something," and
she looked up questioningly into his face.</p>

<p>The picture was a most admirable representation
of the Good Shepherd bearing a lost lamb home on
His shoulders.</p>

<p>Johanson was silent.</p>

<p>"You don't know about it, then? I will tell you,"
she said, and went on, while her tiny finger was impressively
pointing from lamb to shepherd, and from
shepherd to lamb.</p>

<p>"That little lamb got far away from the shepherd
and the fold and all the little lambs he knew. And
he was dirty, not a bit clean, and his wool was all
torn by the briers, and the thorns had hurt him, and
he was hungry and thirsty and tired, and did not
know where to go. He could hear the wolves growl,
and he thought he could see their eyes looking at
him as if they wanted to eat him up. You see he
had run away, just gone away from the Good Shep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>herd and his mother and his home, when he did not
need to. And now he wanted to get back, but he
didn't know how; and then he began to complain
and to bleat (that's his way of crying), and to run
this way and that, but he didn't get on at all.</p>

<p>"At last he was quite tired out, and he thought he
must give up and lie down and die where he was.
Then the Good Shepherd heard his cry and came to
him. The poor little lamb wanted to follow the
Shepherd; but he was too weak&mdash;he could hardly
stand alone. And then"&mdash;and here the little voice
grew triumphantly glad&mdash;"then the Good Shepherd
took him in His own arms, just as sweet and kind as
if the naughty lamb had never run away, and carried
him over the stones, and past the briers, and across
the little streams, and up the steep hills, and through
the dark places! He carried him <i>all the way</i> home,
not just half-way and then let him drop. He carried
him <i>all the way home</i> to the fold, where his mother
was, and there he was safe&mdash;safe&mdash;safe! Wasn't
that a Good Shepherd?"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"My mother told me all about it, and I like that
picture best and that story best. You understand
what it means?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Johanson. There were tears in his
eyes.</p>

<p>Elsa lifted up her loving hand to Johanson's face
as it was bent over the book, and with her own little
handkerchief wiped his tears; then she went out
silently, which was probably the best thing she could
have done under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The next day Johanson went to the pastor in his
study. "I have not come to talk about <i>my</i> fitness
for confirmation," he said. "Little Elsa has taught
me better. I have turned my face towards the Good
Shepherd, and I believe He will carry me home.
May I meet with the class to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the pastor, and the interview
was ended.</p>

<p>Johanson sat among the candidates for confirmation
the next day&mdash;among the boys and girls, like a
battered old ship that had been dragged into the
harbour beside the trim fresh vessels just starting
with flying colours for a bright far-away land.</p>

<p>He did not mind the nudges and half-smiles among
the rustic congregation, but answered the questions
put to him with the others, in his strong man's voice,
as simply and naturally as a child.</p>

<p>He knew he was safe in the hands of the Good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Shepherd, who would carry him tenderly home, and
his heart was full of humble joy.</p>

<p>The administration of the holy communion took
place next day. The newly-confirmed with their
friends were to "go forward," while the rest of the
congregation were to remain in their seats praying
for the young soldiers of Christ, now fully enlisted
under His banner.</p>

<p>Johanson had taken a modest place at the chancel
railing; but even there he was an outcast, for it was
plain that no one was willing to kneel beside him.</p>

<p>The pastor's wife was bowed low with new food
for prayer and thanksgiving. Little Elsa moved
quickly from her mother's side up the aisle, and to
the astonishment and almost horror of the congregation
she knelt by Johanson, her little head not appearing
above the railing; but she held fast to his left hand.
He felt the tender familiar grasp, and it was to him
like the Good Shepherd greeting him through one of
His little ones.</p>

<p>At the close of the service, when all the authorized
words for the occasion had been read, the pastor
stepped to the front of the chancel, and said, in loud,
clear tones,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And the father saw him afar off, and ran and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
fell on his neck, and kissed him." "Him that cometh
to me I will in no wise cast out." "A broken and a
contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise." "Come
unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and
I will give you rest."</p>

<p>"I hope it was not amiss to say those words I did
from the chancel to-day," said the pastor to his wife
when at home and they were alone together. "They
are not in the service, but I could not help it. I
never felt so deeply before how freely and fully God
forgives us&mdash;<i>us</i> Christians as well as what we call
'poor sinners.' Yes, it came over me as it never has
before, and somehow heaven seems nearer, and God
more really my Father and Christ my Saviour. Do
you understand me, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she said&mdash;"yes, dear; and you too
seem nearer to me than ever before."</p>

<p>The pastor answered, tenderly and solemnly: "It
is you, wife, you and Elsa, and that poor Johanson,
who have somehow opened my eyes. I have seen
before, but seen darkly. May God lead me to the
perfect day!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>PAINFUL DISCLOSURES.</h3>


<p>Something about the strange inmate had affected
the mad poet, long a dweller in the
poorhouse, as unusual in that establishment. These
fancies he had versified, and having written the result
down on a half-sheet of paper, he folded it into
a narrow strip, and then twisted it into an almost
impossible knot, and handed it to the person nearest
concerned.</p>

<p>Johanson read with astonishment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It striketh me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gentleman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drive a span,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live high, drink wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask folks to dine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make a dash.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With poorhouse trash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You should not be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With folks like me."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></div></div>

<p>In return, the reply was promptly put under the
poor poet's door:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of who I am, or where belong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please do not whisper in your song."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These communications were followed by a few
days of unusual silence between the neighbours.
The mad poet did not like being answered in rhyme.
Of versification he considered himself the inventor,
and as having therefore an exclusive right to use it,
in conversation or on paper.</p>

<p>At last Johanson made up his mind what course
to pursue in the matter. He went to the poet in a
friendly way, and said to him, "I take you to be a
gentleman who knows how to keep a secret, and
does not mention what he can guess out concerning
other people's matters. I know your principles about
your post-bag. I have heard that you never even
read the address of a letter to be sent off, or the post-mark
of one to be delivered. Now I call that a high
sense of honour."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Just decency<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems to me,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>broke in the poet.</p>

<p>Johanson did not seem to notice the interruption,
but went on: "Now you keep anything you suspect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
about me, anything you can't understand in my ways,
just as secret as if it were written on the back of a
letter. You will, I am sure. So now let us shake
hands upon it." They did, and were established as
better friends than before.</p>

<p>The weather had become extremely cold, but the
poorhouse poet went on his rounds, persisting in being
dressed as in the autumn.</p>

<p>It had been snowing all night, and the cold was
excessive. Johanson was awakened by an unusual
chill in the air. A long point of snow lay along the
floor of his room, as it had drifted in under the not
over-tight door. He dressed and hurried out. The
vestibule was one snow-bank, and the outside door
was wide open. He pushed his way into the poet's
room. It was empty. It was plain that the poor
fellow had been out on his usual rounds, and had
not returned to put up the outer bars, as was his
nightly custom; for the old locks were not to be
relied upon. He probably had not been able to force
his way through the heavy drifts and the wild storm
which was still raging.</p>

<p>The cellar-master was a late sleeper. He woke
now to see Johanson hurrying about, evidently making
ready for a trip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you doing? You are letting the cold
in here, sir," said the old fellow, only half awake.</p>

<p>"The poet is missing. He didn't come home last
night. I shall go and look him up. Have you any
whisky? You have, I know. I saw Gull bring you
in a bottle last night. Let me have it, will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a pull will keep you up," was the answer.</p>

<p>"I don't want it for me," said Johanson hastily;
"it has pulled me down low enough. I'll never
taste it again. But that poor fellow, he may need
it, if I find him."</p>

<p>"You are not going to risk yourself out looking
for <i>him</i>!" said the cellar-master, now fairly awake.
"<i>You</i> are right down crazy. Quiet yourself. He'll
be coming in soon, and making rhymes about his
trip. You don't look over hearty. I should think
you would be afraid to risk it."</p>

<p>"Afraid!" said Johanson. "Have you ever been
in a tornado? Have you been in an earthquake?
Have you been out in a blizzard, with no house
within miles?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" was the threefold reply.</p>

<p>"I've tried them all," said Johanson, "and I am
not afraid of a little snow. Lend me your stick, and
I'm off."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Off he was, but not to return through the long
morning. Towards noon, a party who had been out
with a snow-plough and a sledge came back, bearing
two bodies carefully covered.</p>

<p>The poet was still and white. He had been found
lying under a rock, in a tiny natural cave. On a
ledge near him, in some lightly-sifted snow, he had
traced with his finger:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I must be ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've such a chill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here I'll die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nobody by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who'll cry?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not I!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bag'll be found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's safe and sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There'll be no snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I shall go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There'll be no storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It will be warm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good-night!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good-night!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was good-night indeed for the poorhouse poet.
In his pocket was found a worn scrap of paper, on
which was pencilled his simple creed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The tickets buy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when we die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For where we go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We fix below.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Death clears the track;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We can't come back!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Somehow, I guess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we confess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And say, 'Forgive!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up there we'll live.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Conductors quail,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And kings prevail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When God has said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Alive or dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I own that man,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He save him can."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Johanson there still was life. He had been
found lying close to the dead poet, as if trying to
share with him his little remaining vital warmth.
The doctor, the pastor's wife, and Gull were soon
doing all that was possible to call him back to life.
In a few days he was almost well, for broken down
though he was, he still had some of the vigour of his
naturally strong constitution.</p>

<p>The funeral was over. Johanson was apparently
dozing, lying on his sofa, now in its form for the day;
while Gull and the cellar-master were chatting together
in low, whispering tones.</p>

<p>Gull, who had prepared the body of the poorhouse
poet for interment, now talked over all the items of
the expense with evident satisfaction, and concluded
by saying, "It was a beautiful corpse. It really was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
a pleasure to lay him out, he looked so sweet and
quiet when it was all done."</p>

<p>The cellar-master, who had been helped into a
sleigh to attend, remarked that it was a charming
funeral; he did not know when he had enjoyed
himself so much as on the late occasion.</p>

<p>"What luck he had to come in for the bell!" said
Gull; "he was just in the nick of time. It was
really quite a grand funeral, with the three coffins&mdash;the
baby and the old woman and our young man&mdash;and
the mourners for all. The pastor did it beautiful
too, and the bell sounded so solemn. It is, of
course, another thing when the big bell is rung for
some high body that is carried out. We may be
thankful that we have the little bell rung once a
week for poor folks' funerals in this parish; it is not
so everywhere."</p>

<p>"It would seem more solemn to see the pastor in
his black gloves if he didn't wear them always," said
the cellar-master. "Why does he do it? I never
happened to meet anybody that knew. He's still-like
himself, and nobody likes to ask him questions.
Some people say it is to make him look grand with
fine folks, and to kind of put down them that have
bare hands used to work."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you know about his hands?" asked Gull,
with surprise. "I've known it so many years, it
seems as if everybody must have heard that."</p>

<p>"I don't happen to have inquired into the matter,"
said the cellar-master, somewhat humiliated. "I have
never been one to gossip."</p>

<p>"Why, I was there when it happened," broke out
Gull, eager to tell her story to a new listener.
"He was stable-boy when I was housemaid at the
major's. My lady was sitting in the carriage one
day, and Lars&mdash;we called him Lars then&mdash;was standing
holding the horses. My lady had sent the
coachman in for his cape, for it was getting cold&mdash;just
like her. The horses took fright at a travelling
music-man who came along, and must begin just
then to play. Off they started full run, dragging
Lars, who hung on to the reins until they stopped.
He'd have held on to those reins, I'm sure, till he
died (what he began he always stuck to); and my
lady sitting there in the carriage half scared to death.
The fingers on his left hand were cut to the bones.
They were long healing, and a sight to be seen then
at the best. The right wasn't much better, dragged
along the road as it had been. My lady always
liked Lars after that. He had always been for read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>ing; and when he took it into his head he wanted to
be a priest, she helped him, and other folks helped
him too. He changed his name, as poor fellows do
when they go to Upsala. When my lady and the major
were taken off so sudden with the fever, he kept on
at his learning. He wouldn't have given up if he'd
had to starve. But he didn't, for one way and another
he got on. And then what a wife he picked up, and
a little money with her too; not that it's enough to
wipe out old scores. Those Upsala debts hang after
him, as they have after many another. He's got
them all in one hand now, they say, so that he hasn't
to pay on them more than once a year, and that time
is just coming on. You can see it in him as well as
you can see in the west when there'll be snow next
morning. He's rubbed through so far, but it sits
heavy. I'm not in their kitchen for an odd bit of
work now and then for nothing. I see what I see,
and I hear what I hear. Beda is lonely like, and she's
pleased to have somebody to talk out to. What if
the pastor and his wife should find out who's who!"
she continued, pointing over her shoulder at the supposed
sleeper.</p>

<p>The cellar-master gave a stupid look at her mysterious
face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the major's son over there," she whispered&mdash;"Alf,
who ran off and never came back. I must tell
somebody, if I should die for it. But you mustn't
breathe it to a living soul."</p>

<p>"Not that beautiful young fellow! No, no; you
don't make me believe that. Don't I remember him?
This one isn't a bit like him&mdash;an ugly, worthless-looking
old tramp. He was a wild chap, Alf. My
wife used to tell me it was a shame to let him come
there and drink&mdash;drink down a glass as if he couldn't
swallow it quick enough, and then another, and then
go out to the stable-boy, who was there to help him
home. But that's not Alf. I'd know that handsome
fellow anywhere among a million."</p>

<p>"But that <i>is</i> Alf," she whispered. "When he
was almost frozen to death, the doctor told me to
open his breast and rub him well; and I did. But
what did I find there, hanging on to a black string,
but his mother's picture, in a little locket she gave
him when he was a little fellow; and he was so fond
of it then he would wear it outside his clothes, where
everybody could see, he said. He's willing enough to
hide it now; he don't want to shame such parents, and
that's the only good thing I see about him. I found it
out, and I know it; but I won't tell anybody but you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's Alf! And I helped to make him so! My
wife said I'd rue the day. Now I do. It's very fine
to be called 'cellar-master' when you sit fast in the
poorhouse; but it's a bad business dragging people
down. Think what Alf was and see what he is! I
don't want to talk any more to-day. You go, Gull.
I've got something to think about."</p>

<p>Johanson, lost in his own thoughts, had not noticed
the whispered conversation till his own name of the
past was mentioned. After that, in bitter repentance
he heard the galling words that penetrated his inmost
soul. Now he understood Gull's new politeness to
him, and the kindly willingness with which she saved
him in his degradation, for his mother's sake. She
could not treat him like a common tenant of the
poorhouse, and he was sure she would keep his secret.
With the cellar-master it might be a different thing.
That his companions knew him was an added
humiliation. He had deserved it all; but there was
One who had called Himself the Friend of sinners,
and that Friend had received even him, a poor
prodigal who had returned to his Father's house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.</h3>


<p>The pastor had fallen into the pleasant habit of
having his wife with him when he wrote his
sermons. Alone in the morning he made his researches
and his copious notes for his compilation. In
the evening he talked over with his wife the subject
in hand, before the work of writing really began.
She found him one night, shortly before Christmas,
sitting dolorously before his table covered with papers,
while an unusual cloud overshadowed his face.</p>

<p>"I cannot even think how to begin, wife," he said;
"my thoughts will run in quite another direction. I
feel all the weight of the new year upon me. Those
old debts of mine, that I can never hope to clear off,
hang upon me like a hopeless weight. A few years
less at Upsala, and a good deal less debt, would have
been a far better preparation for such a parish as this."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>The pastor's wife was not at all cast down by this
sorrowful lament. It had long been a familiar strain
to her. She answered cheerily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You had nothing to do with the arrangements as
to what you were to learn at Upsala, and how long
you must be there. You worked hard, and denied
yourself almost the necessaries of life, as you well
know. Now you are here and at your higher mission,
which <i>must</i> be faithfully performed. So you will
have to throw all these cares overboard. Just when
we are to remember that 'God so loved the world,'
we must not forget that He loves us still, every one
of us. We here in this little parsonage are under His
care, and He is not going to let us have burdens
heavier than we can bear. We live simply enough;
there is no faring 'sumptuously every day' here, as
all the parish knows. I have thought out a little
help. We will not give each other anything for
Christmas. If gifts are but an expression of love,
we do not need that kind of expression between us.
For Elsa I have made a big rag doll, dressed in a fine
peasant dress, from the scraps in my piece-bag. We
will have a little Christmas-tree on a table for a
variety, and I have put tinsel round nuts to hang
upon it with the pretty red apples from the garden;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and as to candles, we have enough left from last year.
We will all learn that beautiful carol we had sent us
by mail yesterday. Our good Beda, she must not be
disappointed. I have my uncle's last present to me
in money, which I shall share with her, and give her
the dress from my aunt that I have not yet made up
for myself. The rest of aunty's present will do to
make Christmas cheery for the poorhouse people and
the hard-pinched folks in the parish, who look for a
little from us at this time. So now all those troublesome
matters are blown away. As for the interest
on the old debts, that is not to be paid until January;
and we will leave that to the loving Lord, who has
given us so many blessings, and see now after the
sermon with cheerful, thankful hearts. Come, dear;
now I am ready to hear about it."</p>

<p>And they did begin on the sermon, and it was the
best the pastor had ever written. Something of the
sweet cheerfulness and loving gratitude of the wife
had made its way among the sound theological quotations
and the judicious condensations. There was
new life in the whole, which now came really from
the pastor's uplifted soul, and would find its way to
the stirred hearts of the hearers.</p>

<p>Christmas morning came, and little Elsa was early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
at the poorhouse. She had a present for Johanson.
It was but a bit of work on perforated paper, done
by her own hands&mdash;a lamb outlined in gay silk; but
it was a <i>lamb</i>, and she felt that meant something
between her and Johanson, and it did.</p>

<p>He was moved when he took it, and thanked her
with good wishes for Christmas from the depths of
his heart.</p>

<p>"I am so happy, Johanson," she said, "for papa
and mamma are so glad. I heard them say, 'Now
the past is all wiped away, and we can begin the new
year as free from care as the birds.' I have often
heard mamma say that the past is all, all wiped away
when we are sorry for what we have done and want
to do better, and I am always so glad about that.
But this, I am sure, meant something different; for
they said something about a letter, and then they
looked together at a paper as if they could kiss it,
and said, 'We must thank God for it, and ask Him to
bless an unknown friend with His best blessings.'
And they just talked to God where they sat, as they
do sometimes. Papa has been sorrowful lately, but
he really looked to-day like mamma when she is the
happiest."</p>

<p>The child had found Johanson bowed, sitting with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
his head in his hands, while his thoughts were far
back in his sinful, sorrowful past. He had felt as if
he had hardly a right to welcome the day when the
Saviour was born. Now his face beamed with joy;
but he only said, "I am glad you are all so happy.
I am sure you will be pleased again when you see
something in church to-day."</p>

<p>Many weeks before Christmas, Johanson had asked
permission to go into the church, and to have a tall
ladder carried in with him. The pastor was astonished
at the request. The permission had been
granted. No results of the matter had, however,
appeared. The same permission had been given the
day before. There had been some hammering then,
he understood, but had no misgivings in the matter,
as he had begun to trust Johanson as an upright,
honest man.</p>

<p>There were surprise and delight on all faces when
they entered the church for the early service on
Christmas morning. Of course there was a perfect
blaze of light within, but that they had expected.
The golden cross was gone; the red curtain had disappeared;
the old picture, now but a ragged canvas,
had been removed, and in its place was a beautiful
painting. It represented the Lord Jesus, sitting with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
a glory round His benign countenance, welcoming a
penitent, weary pilgrim from afar, who knelt to
receive His blessing. Below was the legend, "Him
that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out."</p>

<p>The carol that was sung was the same that the
pastor's wife had chosen to be used at the lighting of
the tree in her own home the evening before. The
rural choir had practised it well, and it sounded out
over the old church like angelic music.</p>

<p>At the first notes Johanson started and covered
his face with his hands. A moment later, though he
held no notes to follow, his beautiful voice rang out
loud and clear and in full harmony with the other
singers.</p>

<p>When the service was over, there was a crowd
lingering in the aisles, praising and admiring the
beautiful picture and the new carol; but Johanson
was soon alone in the poorhouse, with "Hosanna!
hosanna!" in his heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE BEATA CHARITY.</h3>


<p>Gull had come to the cellar-master with a choice
bit of news to tell. A stranger had bought
the land where the major's home and stood, and
buildings were to be put up there immediately.
The long lonely spot was soon a busy scene, as the
architect, with plans in hand, was hurrying about
among the skilful workmen.</p>

<p>Whoever would, might hear where the new poorhouse
was to stand, and where the orphan home, and
know that the little red cottage, just like any other,
was for a musical composer, who must have one large
room built with special care and according to all the
most scientific acoustic rules; for there he was to
have a fine organ, which was now being constructed
in the most particular manner. "I want to call it
all 'The Beata Charity,' for Beata was my mother's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
name," Johanson had said to the pastor, who was
now in his full confidence. They knew each other
as the Alf and Lars of the olden time. They knew
each other now as forgiven sinners, each striving in
his own way to work for the glory of the Master's
kingdom. Each felt that he was indebted to the
other. The stable-boy's words, "The duties are the
same whether you make the promises or not," had
lingered in the mind of the wanderer in the midst of
the lowest depths of sin, and had brought him home
at last to try <i>to make the promises firmly resolved to
keep them</i>.</p>

<p>The methodical, authorized, ordained, instructed,
conscientious priest had learned from a repentant
sinner to bow at the foot of the Cross, and thank
God for the Saviour who could forgive him his poor,
blind, cold, self-satisfied service of the past, and wake
him to penitence and love, and humble, grateful
faithfulness in his sacred office.</p>

<p>Johanson's work in the poorhouse on his music-paper
had been the solace of those long, dark penitential
hours. His alternations between deep depression
and dawning hope, and at last his full, deep
conviction that there was pardon for all in the
abundant mercy of God through Christ, had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
expressed in the musical compositions that had made
their way over the length and breadth of the land.</p>

<p>Many of them were linked with old familiar sacred
words; for others, some master-poet must be warmed
to write their language in glowing verse.</p>

<p>"The white-haired pauper," as Johanson was called
throughout the whole country, had his satisfaction in
his life-long incognito. He felt that he had cast
aside his old name and old privileges to be a worthless
wanderer, and had but returned to repent and
be forgiven. He would, himself forgotten and unknown,
praise and serve as God had given him
ability.</p>

<p>The grand-uncle in America, so munificent for
Alf's confirmation day, had always cherished a hope
of the prodigal's reformation. Only when in desperate
need had Alf applied to him, and had never
been refused assistance. Dying, the old man had
left a will bequeathing his large fortune to his grand-nephew,
in the firm belief that Alf, having run his
wild career, would find his way to his native land, to
lead a faithful Christian life, and be the centre of
wide benevolent enterprises.</p>

<p>The hopes and wishes and prayers of the uncle
were fulfilled. The white-haired pauper lived to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the results of his efforts, and to know that many
who starving had been fed, or sinning reclaimed, or
suffering ministered unto, were calling down blessings
on his unworthy head.</p>

<p>From the pastor and his wife and Elsa Alf had
sympathy and aid in all his undertakings, and their
friendship was cemented by common work for the
common good.</p>

<p>The cellar-master did not live to have a place in
the new poorhouse. Gull had her own trial in the
midst of the comforts of her old age, that she must
still keep the secret that the celebrated composer and
wide philanthropist was her beloved "major's" long-lost
son.</p>
